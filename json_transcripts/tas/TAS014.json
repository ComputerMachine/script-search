My people  are cautious, what you would call cowards."], ["VEDALA", " As an expert lockpick and thief, you are welcome. Em3green.  Lara (the female) is a hunter.

Captain Kirk for his  leadership and adaptability. Tchar will explain your mission."], ["TCHAR", " Two centuries past, my people, the Skorr, were great warriors.  We had advanced military technology and we could breed vast armies  rapidly. But today we are a civilised people because of Alar.

In two standard years, the existing  Skorr could breed an army of two hundred billion warriors."], ["TCHAR", " My government fears this, so the theft of the Soul of Alar has  been kept secret. But we must recover it before my people discover it  gone and go mad, launch a jihad, a holy war on the galaxy."], ["KIRK", " Who took the Soul?"], ["VEDALA", " Unknown. The motive, as Tchar has said, to provoke a holy war."], ["SPOCK", " Is there any clue to its location?"], ["VEDALA", " A mad planet, Geologically unstable. Constant earthquakes,  gravitic shifts, tidal waves. The temperature varies from twenty Kelvin  to two hundred and four above. Somewhere on that planet, the Soul of  Alar is hidden. Three expeditions have tried to recover it. Three  expeditions have been lost. You are the next, if you agree."], ["KIRK", " The Vedala are a powerful race.

I want an  overview."], ["TCHAR", " I will scout overhead."], ["(Tchar flies off)"], ["SPOCK", " The Vedala will have been efficient in equipping us. I will  acquaint myself with our supplies."], ["LARA", " Vulcans. Never liked them much myself. Cold-blooded critters, all  of them."], ["KIRK", " I wouldn't say that. Mister Spock is a unique personality."], ["LARA", " But not human like you and me. Maybe you got different customs.  My world there's a lot of females, not so many men.

But we're not here on a pleasure trip, Lara."], ["LARA", " All the more reason to take what pleasure there might be in it."], ["SPOCK", " I have checked the supplies, Captain.

I'll cover you."], ["(Kirk and Lara shoot the dragons, and they explode)"], ["KIRK", " They're mechanical."], ["SPOCK", " The Vedala were right.
