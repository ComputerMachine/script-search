Captain's log, stardate 5577.3. We are approaching the remains of the
burnt out supernova Arachna. Requested update survey will begin with
measurements of its radiation and volume expansion. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SPOCK: Arachna is entering its cycle of strongest
emissions, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Uhura, inform Starbase Twenty Three we have arrived at the gas
cloud and are starting to map. <br/>
UHURA: Captain, I'm getting some interference on subspace extreme upper
registers. If it's a signal, I don't recognise it. <br/>
KIRK: Source? <br/>
UHURA: The star Cepheus. From its single satellite. That area's never
produced radio transmissions before. <br/>
KIRK: Put it on the speaker. <br/>
SPOCK: Signals appear random. Perhaps some are beyond our reception
capability. <br/>
KIRK: Could be a natural radio source newly energised by <br/>
SPOCK: Correction. One isolated word pattern detected. If you accept
intersat code as still operative. <br/>
UHURA: Intersat? That's been out of use for two centuries. <br/>
SPOCK: The code word is t-e-r-r-a-t-i-n. <br/>
UHURA: It's stopped now, sir. No response at all to our signal. <br/>
SPOCK: Computers show no immediate information on the word terratin. <br/>
KIRK: Was the word totally random, Mister Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: No, sir. It was repeated twice in the transmission. <br/>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, lay in a course for Cepheus. <br/>
SULU: Aye, sir. <br/>
MCCOY: Jim, you don't mean you're going to abandon the mapping mission
to check out some meaningless signal? <br/>
KIRK: Meaningless at the moment, Bones, but it was sent twice. Odds
against that occurring in a totally random transmission are too high to
ignore. There may be some intelligence trying to contact us. Mister
Spock, continue research on the word terratin. <br/>
SPOCK: Yes, sir. <br/>
MCCOY: It's a waste of time if you ask me. <br/>
(Arriving at the star) <br/>
SPOCK: Only data is from early exploration. Planet is listed as Class
M, core molten, mantle and crust entirely crystalline. <br/>
KIRK: But nothing in the computer banks about surface eruptions.
There's our likely radio source, simply crystalline projections of
recent volcanic activity. <br/>
(But down on the planet, a radio dish is definitely doing something) <br/>
KIRK: Set for a single elliptic orbit. <br/>
SULU: Aye, sir. Entering orbit now. <br/>
SPOCK: I register a disturbance, Captain. As if an impulse just passed
through the ship. <br/>
KIRK: Type and source? <br/>
SPOCK: Unidentified. It's extremely faint and diffused. Captain, I
suggest we delay orbit until it can be analysed for nature and effect. <br/>
KIRK: Bridge reports. <br/>
SULU: All instruments functioning, ship's condition normal, all area
status lights are green. <br/>
AREX: Sensors detect nothing abnormal, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, how are your engines? </font></p>

signs of shock. <br/>
(The mice are semi-transparent) <br/>
CHAPEL: Our halo fish is bright as ever, Doctor. Now, this species
loses all colour at the least environmental change. <br/>
KIRK [OC]: Very well. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: Well, Spock, your x-waves seem harmless
enough. Make your analysis while we proceed into orbit. Commence your
sensor sweep, Mister Arex. <br/>
AREX: Sensors show crystalline surface heavily fractured by lava flows.
Ash and smoke suspended in oxygen-nitrogen atmos <br/>
(He's cut off by a loud noise, and the Enterprise glows like a halo
fish) <br/>
AREX: My eyes! <br/>
(Everybody glows for a while, then it stops as suddenly as it started) <br/>
KIRK: Anyone hurt here? <br/>
VARIOUS: No, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Lieutenant Arex? <br/>
AREX: No injury, sir. <br/>
UHURA: Damage reports, all ship areas, damage reports. <br/>
SULU: All instruments functioning normally. Maintaining orbit. But
strictly on impulse power, sir. <br/>
SPOCK: Wave bombardment reduced, but continuing. Deflector shields
ineffective. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SCOTT: Engineering. No casualties, Captain, but
trouble aplenty with the engines. Every dilithium crystal connection's
smashed in the warp engine circuitry. We're trying to bypass them now. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: What about main circuits? <br/>
SCOTT: Well, you have to see it to believe it, sir. Those big crystals
in there have come apart. Each of them unpeeling like the rind of an
orange. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: Analysis, Spock. <br/>
SCOTT: Our only hope now is rewiring impulse. But there are a thousand
broken connections. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, this is quite unprecedented. Notice the fracturing is
spiro-form, similar to long chain molecules. <br/>
KIRK: But dilithium molecules are the hardest, most rigid <br/>
GABLER: Mister Scott! More trouble with the circuit work. <br/>
SCOTT: What now, Gabler? <br/>
GABLER: All the tools, sir. They're too big for us to handle. <br/>
SCOTT: You sound like you're blathering, man. Wait, I'm coming. <br/>
KIRK: Spock, are you slumping? <br/>
SPOCK: I have never slumped in my life, Captain, but I was about to ask
you the same <br/>
BRIEL [OC]: Security! Anyone, please! Mess Officer Briel requesting
help in the Main Dining Room. Tables, chairs, silverware, everything
seems to have enlarged. Women losing rings, hairpins. Some are near
panic. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> UHURA: Captain, the most incredible thing is
happening. <br/>
KIRK: We know. The whole ship has apparently expanded. <br/>
SPOCK: An equally good possibility is that ship's personnel have
contracted, and may be continuing to shrink. <br/>
KIRK: Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Shut down all unnecessary
systems. Get every ounce of impulse power. We've got to get away from
this planet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Captain's log, stardate 5577.5. Our limited power
attempt to escape the planet's gravity has failed. Undefined wave
bombardment continues, resulting in a contraction of our bodies, or an
expansion of the ship, by a factor of point three. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> UHURA: No reply to our mayday, Captain. I don't
believe we have enough power to transmit to Starbase Twenty Three. <br/>
KIRK: Very well. Spock, what have you learned about the wave bombarding
us? <br/>
SPOCK: Only that it is complex beyond anything in my experience. <br/>
SCOTT [OC]: Engineering to Captain Kirk. <br/>
KIRK: Kirk here. How are they holding out, Scotty? <br/>
SCOTT [OC]: We've replaced all the damaged parts we can. With all
that's draining them, the well will soon enough run dry, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Thank you, Scotty. Kirk out. Uhura, reduce mayday signals. One
per ten minute cycle. Cut down sensor sweeps, Mister Arex. <br/>
AREX: Visual sweeps are already impossible, sir. My eyes no longer fit
the opticals. <br/>
UHURA: (climbing on the console) And I can't reach the dial I turned
five minutes ago. <br/>
KIRK: Kirk to Sickbay. <br/>
MCCOY [OC]: Sickbay. McCoy here. <br/>
KIRK: Bones, I need some answers. What's happening to us? <br/>
MCCOY [OC]: Come down tot the lab, Jim. I may have something for you
now. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Medical lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MCCOY: There's the test tissue, Jim, compared with
the stable infrared. <br/>
KIRK: Then Spock's theory is right. We're contracting. <br/>
MCCOY: That's why our weight remains the same, same number of atoms.
The effect is just reducing the space between the molecules. It's
something I've never seen before. <br/>
SPOCK: Agreed. And it is accelerating. <br/>
KIRK: How long can it keep on? <br/>
SPOCK: Ad infinitum, perhaps, considering distance between atoms is
relatively as great as between stars. <br/>
CHAPEL: Doctor McCoy, the animals! They're getting too small for the
cage mesh. All the gossamers are out. And look how tiny they've gotten.
They're just like halo fish. It's tadpole-sized now. <br/>
(Spock notices Christine's bracelet) <br/>
SPOCK: Miss Chapel, what is the composition of this decoration? <br/>
CHAPEL: It was made for me by the titanium smiths of Libra, but it was
an arm bracelet. More like a necklace now. <br/>
SPOCK: Yet the uniform on which you wear it fits as well as ever.
Uniform made of algae-based xenylon, I believe. <br/>
MCCOY: Aren't all our uniforms xenylon? <br/>
KIRK: Yes, and they've all been shrinking proportionately with us. <br/>
SPOCK: This coral decoration for the aquarium is also shrinking. yet
the meteoritic rock in there is unchanged. <br/>
MCCOY: That means only organic matter is affected. But how? <br/>
SPOCK: The wave tends to wind tight such spiral molecules as dilithium.
There is one other molecular structure <br/>
KIRK: Of course, the double helix of DNA, nucleus of every cell in our
bodies. What happens when DNA is compacted completely? <br/>
MCCOY: The strands wouldn't break, Jim, they'd just quit winding. <br/>
KIRK: Then we can calculate the limits to our shrinkage. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SPOCK: It's possible. I'll feed the data into the
computer banks. <br/>
KIRK: Something else we'd better determine first. How long can we
expect to maintain control of our ship? <br/>
SPOCK: The computer will project the point at which systems' switches
and buttons will be beyond our ability to operate. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Captain's log, stardate 5577.7. We will lose
effective control of this vessel at the point when we've become
approximately one centimetre tall. At the present rate, we will reach
this less-than-fingernail length in thirty two minutes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sulu and Ares are standing on ladders to reach
their consoles) <br/>
KIRK: Spock, how small will we ultimately shrink? <br/>
SPOCK: No information on that as yet, sir. I do have one read-out on
full spiroid wave analysis. That will take approximately eight years. <br/>
KIRK: Bypass that analysis. We've got twenty nine minutes before we're
too small to operate ship controls. Everyone continue to jury-rig
miniature control mechanisms. There's nothing more we can do. <br/>
SULU: But there is, Captain. Request permission to direct phaser fire
at the planet. Just let me set for ten seconds, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Aiming at what, Mister Sulu? So far all source studies have shown
the waves come from an area as large as one sixth the planet's surface.
Phaser fire will only waste power. <br/>
SULU: What good will it do to wait like this? Just one burst sir, one
single <br/>
(The navigation dial moves and knocks Sulu to the floor - a long way
down) <br/>
KIRK: Sulu! I think his leg's broken. We'll need a splint. <br/>
(Sulu is splinted up) <br/>
KIRK: Let's get him to Sickbay. Every one back to stations. <br/>
(But there's a problem, as everyone is now so small even Spock has to
lean hard on a button to activate it) <br/>
KIRK: The electric eye. We've grown too small to make it work. <br/>
(He finds a pin or something similar on the floor and waves it in front
of the detector. The turbolift doors open) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MCCOY: What happened? <br/>
KIRK: He fell from the console top. <br/>
MCCOY: More and more fall injuries coming. Compound fracture. <br/>
CHAPEL: Oh, if only we could use our bone-knitting laser. Doctor McCoy.
That microscope laser, the one designed to heal the middle ear,
wouldn't it work here? <br/>
MCCOY: It's certainly worth a try. <br/>
CHAPEL: It's in the lab shelf supplies. I'll get it. </font></p>

something and falls into the fish tank) <br/>

to her) <br/>
CHAPEL: Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! <br/>
(As she starts to sink, he throws a needle like a javelin. It has a
line of thread attached to it. She grabs it and is pulled out) <br/>
KIRK: No more climbing heights for you, Nurse. Got that clear? <br/>
CHAPEL: Yes, Captain. But I've also got the miniature laser. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: How is it, Sulu? <br/>
SULU: I can feel it knitting, sir. <br/>
SPOCK: Results on DNA reduction limits have come through, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: What are they? <br/>
SPOCK: Factor of thirty two point nine. <br/>
KIRK: In other words, we're going down to one sixteenth of an inch
high. <br/>
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Well past the operative point of Enterprise
controls. <br/>
KIRK: Can you calculate the geographic centre of the wave emissions
from the planet's surface? <br/>
SPOCK: Easily, Captain. May I ask the purpose? <br/>
KIRK: It's as good a place as any to beam down. <br/>
(He opens a communicator almost as big as he is) <br/>
KIRK: Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, can you hear me? <br/>
SCOTT [OC]: Barely, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Get a crew down to transporter room three. We have twenty minutes
left while we can still operate transporter controls. <br/>
SCOTT [OC]: How many beaming down, Captain? <br/>
KIRK: One, Scotty. Myself. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Captain's log, supplemental. There is one last
measure we can take to try and stop the bombardment of the lethal
spiroid wave. There must be some intelligence behind it. I'm going to
attempt direct communication by beaming down to the planet's surface.
We have no reason to expect success, but our height is little more than
two inches and even this action will be beyond us in fifteen minutes
time. </font></p>

sir. <br/>
KIRK: Thanks, Spock. <br/>
SPOCK: It's range cannot be guaranteed. How will we pinpoint you for
return in case it fails? <br/>
KIRK: Scotty, set automatic return for me. If there's anything to be
found down there, ten minutes should do it. <br/>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. Timer being set. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, the transporter retains a memory of the body's
molecular structure. Will it apply as well to your present height? <br/>
KIRK: We'll know that in ten minutes. After that, it won't matter
anymore. Prepare to energise. <br/>
SPOCK: Good luck, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Energise! <br/>
SCOTT: All right then. Heave, lads. Heave! </font></p>

problem. The transporter beam apparently returns our molecules to
normal spacing. Kirk to Enterprise, do you read me? <br/>
SPOCK [OC]: We read you, Captain. Wave bombardment has just ceased. <br/>

them now, for damage done your starship. Be assured, this land contains
much dilithium to replace that you lost. <br/>

SCOTT: Last of the crew beamed up, sir. Dilithium supplies are fully
restored. <br/>
KIRK: Mister Arex, prepare for immediate departure from this area. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, what about the people on the planet? <br/>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, direct forward phasers at the Terratin city. Set for
pinpoint fire pattern. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Transporter room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The phaser is fired, and the city is beamed
aboard) <br/>
KIRK: Spock, the macroscope. (viewing the tiny people) Mendant, we
welcome your people aboard the Enterprise. <br/>
MENDANT [through macroscope]: Captain Kirk, we welcome your eye upon
our city. <br/>
KIRK: We're now headed for your new home. The planet Verdanis, ten days
distant. <br/>
MENDANT [through macroscope]: Is it beautiful, as we were told? <br/>
KIRK: Very beautiful, much like Earth. <br/>
MENDANT [through macroscope]: People of the Enterprise, we have no way
to pay the debt we owe. But this at least comes from a meeting of all
our numbers. We name you honorary Terratins now, and for all time to
come. <br/>
SPOCK: We came rather close to making it more than honorary. <br/>
KIRK: Yes, I'd say just about a sixteenth of an inch close. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Captain's log, supplemental. The Lilliputian city
is to be taken to Verdanis and relocated on a fertile and well-watered
plain. Then we'll be able to call the Terratin incident closed. </font>
