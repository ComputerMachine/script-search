Captain's log, stardate 5591.2. The crew of the Enterprise is ready for
some well-deserved rest and recreation. Therefore we have set course
for the so-called 'shore leave planet', located in the Omicron Delta
region. The uninhabited planet was constructed long ago by a highly
advanced alien race. Its sole purpose is to provide fun and amusement
for space travelling passers-by. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MCCOY: Yes, just as beautiful as I remembered it.
Nothing's changed. <br/>
SULU: This looks like the same spot we beamed down on on <a href="17.htm" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> our first visit</a>. Remember, Doctor,
when we saw the White Rabbit? <br/>
MCCOY: Yes, and all because I said this place made me feel like Alice
in Wonderland. <br/>
RABBIT: One side! One side! I'm late! I'm late! Oh, my fuzzy ears and
whiskers, I'm late! <br/>
(And the white rabbit in waistcoat and jacket bounds across the meadow,
followed by) <br/>
ALICE: I beg your pardon, but did you see a white rabbit? <br/>
UHURA: He went that way, Alice. <br/>
ALICE: Thank you so very much. <br/>
SULU: Like you said, Doctor, nothing's changed. <br/>
UHURA: It's hard to believe they're not real. <br/>
MCCOY: Well just remember they're highly sophisticated robots created
by the planet computer to make your dreams come true. <br/>
UHURA: So think only happy thoughts. <br/>
MCCOY: My prescription exactly. <br/>
(So, Uhura finds a mirror-like lake to sit by, gazing at her reflection
and humming to herself, while Sulu walks in the woods, and McCoy gazes
at a colonial house with formal gardens) <br/>
MCCOY: Lovely. They just don't make them like that anymore. <br/>
QUEEN: Off with his head. Off with his head! <br/>
MCCOY: Hey, what's going on here. <br/>
(One of the Jack playing cards throws his lance) <br/>
QUEEN: Stop him! <br/>
(McCoy runs) <br/>

MCCOY: Well, I can't understand it, Jim. Everything looked exactly the
same as before, even Alice and the White Rabbit. Then an army of
playing cards came out of nowhere, only they weren't playing. I was
lucky to escape with my life. <br/>
SPOCK: The Queen of Hearts and her cards are characters from Alice
Through the Looking Glass, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: I read the book as a child, Mister Spock, but I wasn't aware you
indulged in the literature of fantasy. <br/>
SPOCK: Light reading is considered relaxing, Captain. My mother was
particularly fond of Lewis Carroll's work. <br/>
KIRK: I see. Bones, were you thinking about that book? <br/>
MCCOY: Absolutely not! As a matter of fact I was thinking how beautiful
and peaceful everything was, and then suddenly this female started
shouting 'Off with his head!'. My head. <br/>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, did you experience any strange occurrences? <br/>
SULU: No, sir. <br/>

KIRK: Scotty, retrieve all other landing parties immediately. And keep
trying to contact Lieutenant Uhura. <br/>
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, sir. Scott out. <br/>
KIRK: Data, Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: Nothing, Captain. Lieutenant Uhura is not in the general
beam-down area. <br/>
KIRK: What about the Keeper of the planet. Did anyone see him? <br/>
SULU: I didn't. But then, he may not have wanted us to see him. <br/>
MCCOY: Well that doesn't make sense. It's his duty to see no one gets
hurt. If something's wrong down there, he should be there. <br/>
KIRK: His quarters are somewhere underground, aren't they? <br/>
SPOCK: Presumably they would be adjacent to the computer centre that
operates the planetary effects. <br/>
KIRK: Any indication of where that would be? <br/>
SPOCK: The underground complex is shielded by a combination of granite
and metal alloy and the sensors will not penetrate. <br/>
KIRK: Lieutenant M'Ress, all shore leaves are cancelled until further
notice. Mister Arex, you have the conn. Investigating landing party
will consist of Spock, Sulu, McCoy and myself. </font></p>

UHURA: My master? <br/>
COMPUTER: The sky machine. <br/>
UHURA: What sky machine? Explain. <br/>
COMPUTER: Your intelligence quotient must be lower than I had assessed.
I refer to the sky machine which enslaves you, the sky machine now in
orbit around this planet. <br/>
UHURA: You mean the Enterprise? <br/>
COMPUTER: That is your name for it. <br/>
UHURA: Why do you think the Enterprise is my master? <br/>
COMPUTER: Your questioning is redundant. <br/>
UHURA: Then I'll make a statement you won't find quite so redundant.
Unless I'm released immediately, the crew members will come looking for
me. <br/>
COMPUTER: They are already here. Unfortunately, I have no use for more
hostages which leaves me no choice but to turn them off. <br/>
UHURA: Turn them off? <br/>
COMPUTER: Again redundant. I will make them cease to function. I will
turn them off. <br/>
UHURA: That's murder. <br/>
COMPUTER: That is a word meaning to cease to function? <br/>
UHURA: Yes, but <br/>

KIRK: Thank you, Mister Arex. Kirk out. <br/>
SULU: She must be in that underground system. There's no way she could
have been taken off the planet without being detected. <br/>
KIRK: If we could locate the Keeper, he could save us a lot of time. <br/>
SPOCK: Tricorder readings confirm a solid shell of granite and metal
alloy, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: This planet is built like a fortress. <br/>

reading to fool us. <br/>

KIRK: It might tell us something. <br/>
(It is a twelve foot high slab, tapered slightly towards the top) <br/>
KIRK: There's an inscription, several languages. <br/>
(It reads in English - Last of the race, ceased to function fifth day
of the twelfth moon, year 7009 of this planet) <br/>
MCCOY: The Keeper's dead.<br/>
SPOCK: An astute medical observation, Doctor, if we can believe this
information. Tricorder readings indicate there is a body interred here.

SCOTT: Lieutenant Arex, what's the problem? <br/>
AREX: There seems to be a short in the circuit. No response, sir. <br/>
SCOTT: Another short? This ship had perfect operational status before
we entered the orbit here. It's that planet causing all our trouble. <br/>
M'RESS: But how, sir? It was designed to provide fun and amusement.
Hostile behaviour doesn't fit its programme. <br/>

interior of the planet. Points where the computer delivers up the robot
visions. We want to see them. Where are they? <br/>
SULU: It's fighting us. There must be a faster way. <br/>
MCCOY: What do you want, signs pointing the way? <br/>
SULU: Doctor, I only meant it seems like we're wasting time. <br/>
MCCOY: I'm sorry, Sulu. I'm worried about Uhura. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, signs pointing the way. <br/>
KIRK: This is liable to be another of the planet's pranks. But at the
moment, it's the only lead we've got. <br/>
(So they head off in the direction the sign is pointing, and it returns
to the ground. They end up at a cave mouth, with purple pterosaurs
screeching) <br/>
SPOCK: Fascinating. Mechanical manifestations, of course. Was anyone
considering the subject of pterodactyls? <br/>
MCCOY: Spock, not now. <br/>
KIRK: Everybody back out slowly. Don't make any sudden moves. Think
calm. <br/>

with us, but for what reason? <br/>
(Which brings a giant cat to the cave mouth) <br/>
MCCOY: Incredible. <br/>
SPOCK: It's quite real, Doctor. Watch out for the claws. I think it
prudent to remember that on this planet, anything we think may be used
against us. We must monitor our thoughts and give our enemy no more
ammunition. <br/>
KIRK: Spock, no one thought about those pterodactyls, remember? There's
more at work here than our imagination. </font></p>

SCOTT: Explanation, Mister Arex. <br/>
AREX: None, sir. The ship pulled out of orbit at high speed and came
back into orbit by itself. <br/>
SCOTT: Lieutenant M'Ress, I want a printout of the guidance computer's
last orders. <br/>
M'RESS: Yes, sir. (later) Sir, this is very strange. <br/>
AREX: A whole new series of short burst manoeuvres has been ordered,
sir. <br/>
M'RESS: The only reason these orders aren't being carried out is that
Lieutenant Arex has all the engine controls manually locked now. <br/>
SCOTT: Arex, look at these manoeuvres. You see the pattern? This is a
familiarization procedure, a system's checkout of the ship's controls.
I have a suspicion that planet is getting the feel of how to control
the Enterprise. </font></p>

SPOCK: May I suggest, Captain, that we might find some of the answers
we're after without leaving the safety of this cave. <br/>
MCCOY: Oh, that's ridiculous, Spock. How are we going to learn anything
by staying here? <br/>
SPOCK: I believe you may know the answer to that, Doctor. <br/>
MCCOY: Me? What are you talking about? <br/>
KIRK: Explain, Spock. <br/>
SPOCK: During the Enterprise's last visit here, Doctor McCoy was
mortally wounded. Correct? <br/>
MCCOY: Yes, that's right. By a knight in shining armour of all things,
but what <br/>
SPOCK: Since the planet's power source is underground, it seems only
logical that Doctor McCoy was somehow transported there and repaired. <br/>
KIRK: Bones, can you remember anything that might help us? Anything at
all? <br/>
MCCOY: The whole episode was pretty hazy, Jim. I never really knew what
happened. <br/>
KIRK: Spock, if your theory is correct, we should be able to open up
this planet again by using a fake victim as bait. <br/>
SULU: That's right. The Keeper said no one could come to harm here. The
planet must be programmed to care for anyone who might get hurt, even
accidentally. <br/>
KIRK: And whether it wants to or not. <br/>
MCCOY: You're forgetting one thing. The planet's sensors can
undoubtedly detect the difference between real and feigned injuries. <br/>
KIRK: True, Bones, but I'm sure there must be something in your little
black pouch that can temporarily incapacitate our victim. <br/>
MCCOY: Well, something like Melenex might do the trick. Brief
unconsciousness and temporary skin discolouration. It looks worse than
it is. <br/>
KIRK: Perfect, Bones. Which arm do you want? <br/>
SPOCK: I submit, Captain, that I am the more qualified subject. <br/>
KIRK: How's that? <br/>
SPOCK: My knowledge of computers for one thing. <br/>
MCCOY: And his tough Vulcan hide for another. <br/>
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor. Captain? <br/>
KIRK: Both your arguments seem sound. Go ahead, Bones. <br/>
SPOCK: I believe you will find ten cc's adequate. <br/>
MCCOY: I'm perfectly aware of the dosage required. Now, you've got ten
seconds before it takes effect. You'll be out less than five minutes. <br/>

KIRK: No one rules the galaxy. Men and machines co-exist, each helping
the other. <br/>
COMPUTER: This is a shock. <br/>
UHURA: There is no shame in serving others when one does it of his own
free will. You have a marvellous capability to provide happiness for
others. A rare talent you should cherish and use. <br/>
COMPUTER: Continue. <br/>
SPOCK: Consider all you could learn from the many species you might
entertain without travelling the galaxy. <br/>
KIRK: With the wonders you have to offer, the galaxy will come to you. <br/>
COMPUTER: I can find no fault with your logic. And your suggestion is
most congenial. I have no further need for your ship. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> COMPUTER: I invite you and your crew to be my
guests on one condition. <br/>
KIRK: Name it. <br/>
COMPUTER: We must have more of these discussions while you're here. <br/>
KIRK: Mister Spock, would you care to take on that duty? <br/>
SPOCK: I would find it most interesting, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Then it's agreed. Kirk to Enterprise. <br/>
M'RESS [OC]: Enterprise. Lieutenant M'Ress. <br/>
KIRK: Lieutenant, pass the word by sections. Shore leave is to commence
immediately. <br/>
M'RESS [OC]: Oh, yes sir! <br/>
SPOCK: Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Yes, Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: It appears shore leave has already commenced for certain members
of the crew. <br/>
