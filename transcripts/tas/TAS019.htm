and feet, minute waists and hips, and elongated four fingered hands) <br/>
DRAMIAN: We of Dramia wish to thank you and the others of your
Federation for your invaluable assistance, Captain Kirk. <br/>
KIRK: We hope through our medical assistance programs. to develop and
strengthen relations with star systems such as yours, Supreme Prefect.
Well, shall we? Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us aboard, Scotty. <br/>
DRAMIAN: If you would be so kind, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Belay that, Mister Scott. Yes, sir? <br/>
DRAMIAN: Commander Demos? <br/>
DEMOS: I have here a warrant for the arrest and trial of one of your
party, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Warrant? Who? <br/>
DRAMIAN: Read it, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: (reading scroll) You are hereby directed to surrender for trial
by the people of Dramia, Doctor Leonard McCoy, Medical Officer, USS
Enterprise. Is this some kind of joke? <br/>
DEMOS: The wanton slaughter of hundreds of people is not a joke,
Captain. <br/>
MCCOY: Slaughter? Hundreds of people? <br/>
SPOCK: According to this, Doctor McCoy was responsible for a plague
which ravaged the planet Dramia Two some nineteen years ago, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Let me see that. <br/>
DRAMIAN: As you will note, Captain, the warrant is perfectly in order,
approved by your own Federation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SCOTT: Doctor McCoy arrested? For murder, Captain?
Sir, if you want me and some of the men to beam down, just in case <br/>
KIRK [OC]: No, Mister Scott. The warrant's legal. Mister Spock and I
are at the Hall of Justice. We'll keep you informed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Hall of Justice]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DEMOS: Your Doctor McCoy headed a mass inoculation
programme on Dramia Two, nineteen years ago. When his force left, a
massive plague struck the planet, killing most of its people. <br/>
KIRK: That doesn't mean he was responsible for it. <br/>
DEMOS: His trial will tell, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Trial? You mean kangaroo court. I've heard about Dramian justice.
<br/>
SPOCK: Captain, you're becoming emotional. <br/>
KIRK: Of course I am. Bones harming other beings. You know better,
Spock. I know better. Not Bones. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MCCOY: I wish I could be as sure, Jim. I, I just
don't know. Is it possible that I really did? <br/>
KIRK: Nonsense. <br/>
SPOCK: The termination of your inoculation programme and the subsequent
outbreak of plague could have been coincidence, Doctor. <br/>
MCCOY: Or a tragic mistake on my part. <br/>
KIRK: I don't buy that, Bones. Guard! <br/>
SPOCK: What now, Captain? <br/>
KIRK: Some pre-trial investigation, Mister Spock. On Dramia Two. <br/>
GUARD: Do not be assured by your friend's plans. Dramian justice is
swift. Too swift for them to save you, perhaps. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: Anything yet, Mister Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: No, Captain. The historical records of this solar system are
spotty, at best, going back nineteen years. Mostly they're technical
data, meteor showers, auroras, radiation reports. <br/>
KIRK: There it is. <br/>
SPOCK: Plague, Dramia Two. Of unknown origin, characterised by
pigmentation changes in skin of victim, debilitation, death. Certain
species known to have natural immunity, notably Vulcan. Hmm.
Interesting. <br/>
KIRK: Go on, Mister Spock. </font></p>

Two to investigate the case. <br/>

KIRK: Origin? <br/>
SULU: I'd say Dramia, sir. It appears to be a one-man craft. <br/>
UHURA: Shall I make contact, sir? <br/>
KIRK: Yes. Belay that, Lieutenant. <br/>
SPOCK: You're planning something, Captain? <br/>
KIRK: Unless I miss my guess, that's friend Demos. <br/>
SULU: What if he attacks, sir? <br/>
KIRK: Why should he? We haven't contacted him, so we must not have
detected him. He'd have to explain an attack. Besides, he'll probably
prefer to sneak aboard, seeing that we carelessly left the hangar doors
open. <br/>
UHURA: But the hangar doors aren't open, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Ah, yes. Take care of that oversight, will you, Mister Sulu? <br/>
(Demos sees the hangar doors open, and flies straight in) </font></p>

KIRK: Now, now, Demos. You're hardly in a position to take on an entire
crew. <br/>
DEMOS: And you are not in authority to conduct an investigation in our
star system. <br/>
KIRK: You will remind me to report my conduct to the Federation, won't
you Mister Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: Of course, Captain. <br/>
DEMOS: I demand that you report to the Federation now! <br/>
KIRK: I would, but unfortunately we're out of communications range. <br/>
DEMOS: Then I will proceed to your starbase and report your act. <br/>
KIRK: Sorry, Commander. Your ship is, er, impounded. <br/>

KIRK: Now, now, Mister Spock, you're not trying to scare our Dramian
friend, are you? Of course, you can back out if you'd like, Commander. <br/>

(They see a figure amongst the ruins) <br/>
KIRK: Trouble? <br/>
DEMOS: They do not like outsiders. <br/>
SPOCK: Surely you're not an outsider, Commander. You're Dramian. <br/>

world of the walking dead. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: Cave dwellers? In the midst of your
civilisation? <br/>
DEMOS: A result of your Doctor McCoy and his inhumane methods. <br/>
KIRK: You say it, Demos, but that doesn't <br/>
(Then he is pounced upon by the Dramian they have been chasing. Spock
and Demos pull him off) <br/>
DEMOS: He attacked you because you are an Earthling, Captain, even as
was McCoy. <br/>
KIRK: But how did he survive the plague? <br/>
DEMOS: He, like the others who remain here, was away at the time. They
returned to their planet to find that their families had succumbed to
the plague. He and a few others, senseless in their grief, chose to
live here in desolation. You see, Captain, there were no actual
survivors. <br/>
KOL-TAI: You are wrong. There was a survivor. I, Kol-Tai, survived. By
what miracle, I do not know. <br/>
KIRK: Then you can tell us. Do you remember? <br/>
KOL-TAI: I remember people all about me, becoming blue in colour, then
green and finally red. <br/>
SPOCK: The pigmentation changes associated with the disease in our
computer records, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Kol-Tai. Doctor McCoy, do you remember him? <br/>
KOL-TAI: The Earth doctor. He saved my life. He treated me for Saurian
virus. A man who saves does not also kill, Commander. </font></p>
