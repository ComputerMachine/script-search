Captain's log, stardate 52.2. We have just entered the Delta Triangle,
a vast, uninhabited sector of our galaxy in which a high number of
mysterious disappearances of starships have been recorded since ancient
times. The Enterprise has been assigned the mission of surveying this
area, and if possible, determining the cause of these disappearances. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (There is a continual fireworks display on the
viewscreen. The ship is at Red Alert) <br/>
KIRK: Situation, Mister Spock. <br/>
SPOCK: Our sensors are in a state of chaos, Captain. They became
unreliable when we entered the Triangle. <br/>
KIRK: Magnification ten on forward scanners, Mister Sulu. <br/>
SULU: Magnification ten, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Klingon battle cruiser. Deflector shields up, Mister Sulu. <br/>
SULU: Deflectors up, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency. <br/>
(The Klingon ship fires two shots, which harmlessly hit the shields) <br/>
KIRK: Ready phasers. <br/>
SULU: Phasers locked on target, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Fire. <br/>
SULU: Firing phasers.<br/>
(A hit. The Klingon ship vanishes) <br/>
KIRK: Mister Spock, did you see what I think I just saw? <br/>
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Explanation? <br/>
SPOCK: I can offer none at this time. However, the Klingon ship was not
destroyed by our phaser fire. Its shields clearly deflected the
phasers. Nor was its disappearance the type that would have been
affected if it were using its cloaking device. <br/>
KIRK: Any sensor analysis on that wavering effect just before the ship
disappeared? <br/>
SPOCK: The sensors are still not registering normally, sir. But I would
venture the theory it has something to do with the many ship
disappearances in this area. <br/>
KIRK: A natural phenomenon. But what? Duty personnel on Yellow Alert.
Visual scan three hundred and sixty degrees, Mister Sulu. <br/>
SULU: Scanning three hundred and sixty degrees, sir. <br/>
(There are other ships surrounding them) <br/>
KIRK: Mousetrapped. If the first ship doesn't succeed in blasting us
out of existence, they have two backup ships to do the job. <br/>
SPOCK: Tactically well planned. When the Federation investigates, we'll
be recorded as just another mysterious starship disappearance. <br/>
UHURA: Captain, we are receiving a class two signal from the lead
Klingon vessel. <br/>
KIRK: One moment, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu, on my command, I want you to
turn the Enterprise and head for the exact co-ordinates where the
Klingon ship disappeared. Warp eight. <br/>
SULU: Yes, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Put the signal on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and pipe
the entire exchange back to Starfleet Command. <br/>
UHURA: It will take three weeks to reach the nearest starbase, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Nonetheless, let's have it on the record. <br/>
UHURA: Aye, sir. Signal in. <br/>
KURI [on viewscreen]: You have been identified as the starship
Enterprise. Captain James T Kirk last known to be in command. <br/>
KIRK: Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk. <br/>
KURI [on viewscreen]: I am Commander Kuri of the Klingon Imperial
Fleet. We have witnessed the destruction of our sister ship, the
Klothos, and hold you responsible. Surrender immediately or we will
destroy you. <br/>
KIRK: We did not destroy the Klothos, and you are well aware of it,
Commander. <br/>
KURI [on viewscreen]: Surely you don't expect me to believe she just
vanished? <br/>
KIRK: You may believe what you like, Commander. We were fired upon
first and returned fire. The Klothos deflectors turned aside our phaser
fire and then disappeared. I don't know why. But we are in the Delta
Triangle. <br/>
KURI [on viewscreen]: I do not accept this. <br/>
KIRK: Frankly, Commander, what you accept is of little importance to
me. Enterprise out. Now, Mister Sulu. </font></p>

SCOTT: Sir, aren't we going to defend ourselves? <br/>
KIRK: Your deflector shields are doing that for us, Mister Scott. <br/>
SCOTT: But to just turn and run, sir. <br/>
KIRK: We'll fight if we have to. Sulu, are we headed for the exact
co-ordinates where the Klothos disappeared? <br/>
SULU: Dead on, sir. We'll be there in ten seconds. <br/>
SCOTT: Captain, our deflector shields have just gone out. <br/>
SULU: Sir, the instruments. They've gone haywire. I can't orient
myself. Everything is <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KURI: Where did they go? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> UHURA: Captain, I've lost all co-ordination.
Dizzy. <br/>
SPOCK: Sir, we seem to be suffering from some form of vertigo. <br/>
KIRK: Sulu, are we still on the same co-ordinates? <br/>
SULU: I can't tell, sir. Vision won't focus. <br/>
(He collapses, then the Enterprise reappears) <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, on the viewscreen. <br/>
(A starship graveyard as far as they can see) <br/>
KIRK: It's like a vast Sargasso Sea. A graveyard of ships from every
civilisation imaginable. <br/>
UHURA: Where are we, sir? <br/>
KIRK: At another place in time, I think. If we check closely, I believe
we'll find many of those ships are the ones designated as lost in the
Delta Triangle. <br/>
UHURA: An alternate universe? <br/>
KIRK: Something corresponding to that. The records say every ship lost
here vanished without a trace. Most logged communication loss and
disorientation just before disappearance. My guess was they entered a
window to some other continuum. Comments, Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: Your logic is excellent, Captain. There is a random factor to
the ship disappearances. Perhaps the touching of the two time
continuums is erratic. In any event, the window stayed open long enough
for us to follow the Klothos in. <br/>
SCOTT: Aye, and where is that tricky devil? <br/>
SULU: I've been scanning for her, but there are so many ships here it's
hard to pick up a specific trace. <br/>
KIRK: Stay on it, Mister Sulu. <br/>
SULU: Aye, sir. <br/>
SCOTT: There are ships here I've only seen crude drawings of, pictures
in museums. <br/>
SPOCK: Sensor scans give a rough approximation of the age of the metal
in the hulls, Captain. Some of them have been here for centuries. <br/>
SCOTT: Captain, there's the old Bonaventure. She was the first ship to
have warp drive installed. She vanished without a trace on her third
voyage. <br/>
(Bonaventure looks very like a fat Enterprise, with 0201NCC on the
nacelle)<br/>
SPOCK: The crew's descendants may still be living, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Their descendants? <br/>
SPOCK: Yes. I am picking up life and energy readings from the cluster
of ships ahead of us. </font></p>

 <br/>
XERIUS: (a Vulcan or Romulan) That will not be needed here, Commander
Kor. <br/>
(Then Kirk is beamed in) <br/>
XERIUS: Welcome to Elysia. Devna, Interpreter of Laws. <br/>
DEVNA (an Orion woman) Gentlemen, you now stand before the Ruling
Council. Elysia is comprised of representatives of a hundred and twenty
three races. Our existence dates back over one thousand years. During
this time, these diverse races, many of whom were enemies on the
outside, have learned to live together because they must. As a result,
any act of violence is strictly forbidden, and will be dealt with
swiftly and with utmost severity. Questions? <br/>
KIRK: Are we in an alternate universe? <br/>
DEVNA: It is more aptly described as a pocket in the garment of time. <br/>
KOR: How did you freeze my weaponry? <br/>
DEVNA: We have among us many individuals gifted with psionic powers,
peace being our single goal. You were attempting to break that peace. <br/>
XERIUS: Pronounce the law. <br/>
DEVNA: Under our law, you as ship captains are responsible for the
behaviour of your crews. Should a crew member, with or without your
knowledge, engage in any form of violence whatsoever, you will suffer
the ultimate penalty. Total immobilisation of your ship for a century. <br/>
KOR: A century? We'd all be dead by the end of it. <br/>
XERIUS: No, Commander Kor. This small universe of ours is a curios
trap. Time passes here, but very slowly. A century means nothing to us.
Our Council appears young. Yet all are centuries old. <br/>
KIRK: Your life here must be almost perfect, if you haven't wanted to
leave. <br/>
XERIUS: All of us have wanted to leave at some time, Captain Kirk. But
we have made the best possible world here, because we have found there
is no escape from it. </bbr></font></p>

SPOCK: If we find an answer, it will still take time. <br/>
SCOTT: That's just what we haven't got. <br/>
KIRK: What's wrong, Scotty? <br/>
SCOTT: It's our dilithium crystals, sir. They're deteriorating rapidly.
<br/>
KIRK: But how? <br/>
SCOTT: I don't know, sir. Maybe because of the time warp we went
through. But we've only four days at the most before power goes. <br/>
KIRK: Got any miracles in your computer, Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: Impossible to predict, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: I don't want a prediction. You will start work immediately,
around the clock, nonstop, until you arrive at a formula that gets us

SPOCK: Several times, Captain. I do not wish to surrender hope, but the
facts remain unchangeable. <br/>
KIRK: He isn't giving up. If they can do it, why can't we? <br/>
SPOCK: I do not believe they can, sir. High rank probability. Their S2
graf unit, which is roughly the equivalent of our warp drive, began
giving off depleted energy readings. Kor decided to try to bluff it
through. <br/>

SPOCK: I believe there is, Captain. But not within me. I sensed
something strange about the Klingons when we were aboard the Klothos.
They were too agreeable, too willing to co-operate. <br/>
KIRK: Why is that unusual? They want to get out of here as much as we
do. <br/>
SPOCK: Had I not touched them, I would have agreed with you, Captain.
But even though contact was necessarily limited and their minds were
suspicious, I picked up some indication they are planning to sabotage
the Enterprise. <br/>
KIRK: Sabotage! How? When? <br/>
SPOCK: I cannot say. The Klingon found near the dilithium vault knew
nothing specific. But there is some kind of sabotage in the offing. <br/>
KIRK: They need us to get through the time barrier, if they're to get
through at all. Security, this is Captain Kirk. I want all security
teams on duty around the clock. Watch every Klingon who sets foot
aboard this ship. I don't want one of them to make a move we don't know
