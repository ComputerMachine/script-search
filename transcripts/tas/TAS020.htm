Captain's log, stardate 6334.1. The outbreak of choriocytosis aboard
the Enterprise seems to be under control. Doctor McCoy says the disease
is no longer even as serious as pneumonia, and there should be no
problem completing our present mission, representing the Federation at
the dedication ceremonies for the new Academy of Science on Deneb Five.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: Status, Mister Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: All systems affirmative, Captain. The Enterprise is on course
and on schedule. <br/>
KIRK: It'll be nice to play diplomat for a change, eh, Spock? <br/>
(Spock grimaces in pain and falls to the floor, unconscious. <br/>
KIRK: Kirk to Sickbay. Emergency! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MCCOY: Jim, choriocytosis is a strange disease. In
races with iron-based blood, it's practically nothing, but in others <br/>
KIRK: Get to the point, Bones. <br/>
MCCOY: Spock has contracted the disease. It's fatal to Vulcans. <br/>
KIRK: Are you sure? <br/>
MCCOY: I've triple-checked, Jim. I wish to God I was wrong. Spock's
blood is copper-based. The infection enters the blood stream, and
encases the cells so they can't carry oxygen. <br/>
KIRK: The result is suffocation. <br/>
MCCOY: Yes, Jim. <br/>
KIRK: Is there any cure? <br/>
MCCOY: One. A naturally occurring drug called strobolin. But it's only
found on a few planets in the galaxy. <br/>
KIRK: Library computer. <br/>
COMPUTER: Working. <br/>
KIRK: What is the nearest strobolin supply planet to our present
position? <br/>
COMPUTER: Beta Canopus. Four solar days away at maximum warp. <br/>
KIRK: How long can Spock last without the drug? <br/>
MCCOY: I can give him injections of a synthesised drug that would slow
the disease. But after two days the body builds up an immunity. It
loses its effectiveness. By the end of the third day, the disease will
be irreversible. <br/>
KIRK: It'll take four days to get the drug, but Spock will die in
three. There's got to be a way. <br/>
MCCOY: What about a rendezvous? <br/>
KIRK: Of course. If we cant go out of our way to get the drug in time,
there must be another ship closer to Beta Canopus. Kirk to Bridge. Get
me Starfleet, Lieutenant. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Captain's log, supplemental. We've arranged to get
the strobolin needed to save Mister Spock's life. The starship Potemkin
has already picked up the drug and will transfer it to a freighter, the
SS Huron, for delivery to the Enterprise. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: What will the symptoms be, Bones? <br/>
MCCOY: Increasing tiredness, steadily decreasing efficiency, all the
symptoms of working in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. Kind of like the
test you had to pass back at the Academy. <br/>
(A knock at the door) <br/>
KIRK: Come. <br/>
SPOCK: You wished to see me, sir? <br/>
KIRK: Yes, Spock. Sit down. We've arranged a rendezvous to pick up the
drug you need. <br/>
SPOCK: I trust it will not affect our scheduled arrival at Deneb Five. <br/>
KIRK: No, it won't. <br/>
SPOCK: Will that be all, Captain? <br/>
KIRK: One other thing. I've cut your duty time in half. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, that won't be necessary. I'm quite able <br/>
MCCOY: No arguments, Spock. Doctor's orders. <br/>
SPOCK: Anything else, sir? <br/>
KIRK: That's all, Spock. Dismissed. <br/>
(Spock leaves) <br/>
KIRK: It'll hurt seeing him like that. <br/>
MCCOY: I know. As much as it might seem at times that I can't stand
that pointy-eared encyclopaedia, I don't want to see that happen to
him. </font></p>

just dilithium. <br/>

KIRK: A good place for an intruder to hide, wouldn't you say, Mister
Sulu? <br/>
SULU: Perfect. And a long range sensor can show that the radioactive
residue stops in the middle of the belt. <br/>

KIRK: What was that? <br/>
AREX: These asteroids are composed of a highly unstable mineral
combination, sir. They explode upon impact with each other. <br/>

SCOTT: Captain, if the power of those rocks could be harnessed, they'd
make a fantastic source of energy. <br/>
KIRK: Also make quite a weapon. Steady as she goes, Sulu. <br/>

(The red bat-ship comes on the viewscreen) <br/>
KIRK: Hold position. Analysis, Mister Sulu? <br/>
SULU: Standard phasers, sir. Weak, though. A diffused, low quality
beam. Our deflectors can stop them. <br/>
AREX: I recognise the ship's markings, Captain. It's an Orion. <br/>
KIRK: Orion. <br/>
UHURA: They're hailing us, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Put it on visual, Lieutenant. <br/>
(These Orions are blue-skinned, wearing green suits and half-helmets) <br/>
ORION [on viewscreen]: Enterprise, we demand that you cease your
pursuit immediately. I must protest, as a representative of a neutral
planet. <br/>
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. For a neutral, you were pretty quick to
fire your phasers. <br/>
ORION [on viewscreen]: We couldn't be sure you were non-hostile. <br/>
KIRK: Orion's neutrality has been in dispute ever since the affair
regarding the Coridan planets and the Babel Conference of stardate
3850.3. Yesterday, a Federation freighter was attacked in this
quadrant, its cargo hijacked. As the first alien ship encountered, we
require you to submit to search, as per Babel Resolution A12. Reply. <br/>
ORION [on viewscreen]: We have no Federation cargo aboard. Orions are
not thieves. If you don't cease this harassment, we will lodge a formal
protest with your government. <br/>
KIRK: Hold on that, Uhura. Tell them to stand by. <br/>
SULU: Sensors picking up the dilithium in their hold, sir. <br/>
KIRK: What about the drug? <br/>
SULU: If they have it, it's too small an amount to detect. <br/>
KIRK: Uhura, open the channel. <br/>
UHURA: Channel open, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Enterprise to Orion vessel. I have a proposal to make. If you do
have the Huron's cargo, there were some perishable drugs in it that we
desperately need. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ORION: What would these drugs be worth to you if
we had them? <br/>
KIRK [on viewscreen]: You keep the dilithium shipment, no mention of
the whole incident to Starfleet or in my log, plus and additional
galactic standard weight container of dilithium as payment for the
drug. <br/>
ORION: We get what we want, plus our neutrality remains intact? We will
consider your offer. <br/>

KIRK: Just hold out a little longer. <br/>
UHURA: The Orions are hailing us, sir. <br/>

obvious we can't. <br/>

Spock will die if we don't. <br/>
MCCOY: You've already made up your mind, haven't you, Jim. <br/>
KIRK: Yes, but not without precautions. I'll keep my communicator
channel open so you can hear what goes on. Keep the transporter locked
on me, and if anything goes wrong, Scotty, I'm trusting you. <br/>

ORION: Orion's official neutrality comes before this ship or its crew.
We can't take Kirk's word that he won't report this incident to
Starfleet. <br/>
LIEUTENANT: The only way to do that is to destroy the Enterprise, and
the only way to do that is to destroy ourselves, too. <br/>
ORION: Do you have a plan, Lieutenant? <br/>
LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir. These asteroids are made of highly explosive
minerals. <br/>

that will destroy both ships? <br/>
LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir, but <br/>

LIEUTENANT: Analysis of the asteroid shows that it can't be detonated
by our phasers. <br/>

LIEUTENANT: A powerful explosive right on the asteroid's surface. I
could rig a remote control device. <br/>

LIEUTENANT: Gone? <br/>
ENSIGN: I was scanning as you ordered, and they just disappeared off
the asteroid. Both the Earther and the Captain. <br/>
LIEUTENANT: He's been captured, no doubt. Arm our self-destruct system,

(The Orion goes to put a capsule in his mouth) <br/>
KIRK: Grab him! Poison. I'm sure your ship is ready to self-destruct,
Captain, but if it does, your crew will die for nothing. We're not
going to let you commit suicide. Whether they die or not, you'll still
stand trial, and Orion's little game of neutrality and piracy is over. <br/>
UHURA: I have the Orion vessel, sir. <br/>

MCCOY: Spock, that green blood of yours may have saved you before, but
this time it almost did you in. You can't deny it. <br/>

KIRK: Yes, gentlemen, things are back to normal. <br/>
