Captain's log, stardate 4978.4. We are approaching the Arcadian star
system on a mission to locate an old friend. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: Do you think Harry Mudd is down there,
Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: The probability of his presence on Motherlode is eight one
percent plus or minus point five three. <br/>
MCCOY: Why can't you just say, Mudd's probably there. <br/>
SPOCK: I just did, Doctor. <br/>
AREX: Approaching parking orbit, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Very well, Mister Arex. Spock, let's see how close your
percentage is. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Harry Mudd is giving his spiel to an audience of
humans and bears) <br/>MUDD: Now, you're all heavy metal miners, shrewd and
intelligent. So you can appreciate the incredible value I'm offering.
With this magical liquid, no person of the opposite sex can resist you.
It matters not whether you are young, old, fat, ugly or repugnant. <br/>
(Kirk and Spock beam down) <br/>
MUDD: Nothing personal, gentle beings. <br/>
LADY BEAR: Proof, human. <br/>
MUDD: Proof? Behold. <br/>
(A lovely blonde lady walks up to him) <br/>
LORA: Harry, darling. I was lonely for you. <br/>
MUDD: Behold. I placed a single drop of this miracle substance on
meself, then simply touched this young lady. <br/>
LORA: Please, darling, come back to the ship with me. <br/>
MINER: How much? <br/>
MUDD: Three hundred credits, or the <br/>
MINER: Three hundred? <br/>
MUDD: A bargain, sir. True love is worth any price. Captain Kirk! And
the ineluctable Mister Spock. Welcome to Motherlode, gentlemen.
Interested in purchasing a little love? <br/>
KIRK: We're interested in you, Harry. For fraud, illegal drug
manufacture and swindling. <br/>
MUDD: As I said, welcome to Motherlode, a charming planet which does
not recognise Federation law. <br/>
MINER: So you two can keep out of this. All right, Mudd. You've got a
deal. <br/>
SPOCK: Are you aware that Harry Mudd is tricking you via an illusion? <br/>
MINER: What? <br/>
(Spock fires his phaser at the girl, which turns into a reptile) <br/>
SPOCK: The so-called girl is a Rigelian hypnoid, projecting a simple
illusion. <br/>
(Uproar) <br/>
MUDD: Now, friends. <br/>
KIRK: We can't arrest you, Harry, but you can give yourself up. <br/>
MUDD: No. <br/>
MINER: Thief. <br/>
(The audience start throwing stones) <br/>
MUDD: I surrender myself with free will. Mercy of the law. <br/>
(Spock phasers a ditch and rampart between themselves and the mob) </font></p>

cost me me ship, everything I own. Even the love crystals. I may just
sue you. <br/>

CHAPEL: A minor bruise, Captain. He'll live. <br/>
KIRK: I thought <a href="41.htm" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> we left you on the
robot planet</a>, Harry. Permanently. <br/>
MUDD: Never underestimate the spirit of Harcourt Fenton Mudd. I
borrowed a vehicle. <br/>
SPOCK: Stole a spaceship. <br/>
MUDD: And left to find haven on Ilyra Six. A charming planet, an
innocent and friendly populace. <br/>
KIRK: To whom you sold the Starfleet Space Academy. Harry. <br/>
SPOCK: A fraud. But sold for enough credits to get to Sirius Nine. <br/>
MUDD: Where I discovered a boon to humanoid life, a miracle love
potion. <br/>
KIRK: Which you sold to a thousand inhabitants, who immediately became
ill from using it. <br/>
MUDD: I hadn't counted on their unusual biochemistry. So, I did the
logical thing. I left in haste. <br/>
KIRK: And came here to swindle honest miners. <br/>
MUDD: The love potion works, Captain. If you'll allow me to procure
some from my ship <br/>
(but they leave and activate the forcefield) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Immediately outside the Brig) <br/>
KIRK: Prepare the arrest report, Mister Spock. <br/>
(Kirk leaves) <br/>
SPOCK I shall require a medical report on the prisoner, Miss Chapel. <br/>
CHAPEL: Of course, Mister Spock. I think you deserve congratulations
for trapping him so cleverly. <br/>
SPOCK: You exaggerate, Nurse. Kindly see that your medical summary is
more precise. <br/>
(Spock leaves) <br/>
MUDD: Your Mister Spock is really a very attractive intelligence. <br/>
CHAPEL: An efficient officer, yes. <br/>
MUDD: But a trifle lacking in the warmer emotions. Now, you, Nurse. You
have a wonderful gift to heal the wounded, a fantastic touch. A
womanly, feminine quality. I appreciate that. And I should like to,
well, thank you. <br/>
(He offers her a crystal) <br/>
CHAPEL: What is it? <br/>
MUDD: My love potion. Not illusion, not trickery, dear Nurse Chapel.
Inside this crystal lies the power to create love. <br/>
CHAPEL: No. No, I've heard of your potions before. I don't believe you.
<br/>
MUDD: Think about it, darling. Mister Spock in love with you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> AREX: An uncharted star system ahead, Captain. <br/>
SPOCK: Binary sun with a Class M planet. That's rare enough to warrant
investigation. <br/>
KIRK: Agreed. Take us into orbit, Lieutenant Arex. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Brig]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MUDD: It's really so simple, my dear. You rub the
liquid on yourself, then touch another person. <br/>
CHAPEL: And it creates love in that person? Mudd, that is totally
absurd. <br/>
MUDD: No, it is infallible. One touch evokes friendship between men or
women. But between woman and man, love. Guaranteed. You're not simply a
beautiful woman, you are a scientist. I urge you to take this love
crystal as my gift of gratitude to you. Take it, dear Nurse Chapel, and
conduct your own experiment. <br/>
CHAPEL: Not that I believe you, but, well, I suppose I could analyse
it. <br/>
MUDD: Of course. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> AREX: Parking orbit stable. Weapons systems on
defensive standby. <br/>
SPOCK: No evidence of intelligent life. Atmosphere at surface, eight
hundred millibars, breathable. Gravity one point two. Temperature hot,
but within Class M limits. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The forcefield is down so Mudd can give Chapel
the crystal) <br/>
CHAPEL: I'll let you know the results of my analysis. <br/>
MUDD: Laboratory tests would destroy it, my dear. Why not test it the
way it's meant to be used? <br/>
CHAPEL: No, I <br/>
MUDD: Ah, darling, think. If it does what I say it does, Spock will be
yours forever, my dear. <br/>
CHAPEL: I just break the capsule and rub it on my skin? <br/>
MUDD: And then touch him. <br/>
(She breaks the capsule between her hands, and gasps) <br/>
CHAPEL: What is it? <br/>
MUDD: A temporary effect as the liquid is absorbed. <br/>
(He steps into the corridor to catch her as she wobbles, and take her
pouch) <br/>
MUDD: It'll pass. <br/>
CHAPEL: I feel better. <br/>
MUDD: Didn't I tell you? <br/>
CHAPEL: You should, you should be in the Brig, Harry. <br/>
MUDD: Oh, right you are, darling. <br/>
(He steps back in and she reactivates the forcefield. <br/>
MUDD: Why don't you go find Spock? Can't waste any time, you know. <br/>
CHAPEL: Yes, I'll do that. (Harry uses what he stole from Christine to
get out of the Brig, and change her photo-ID card so he is now
Lieutenant Christine Chapel) </font></p>

CHAPEL: I brought the medical summary for the arrest report, Mister
Spock. <br/>
(She stumbles and ends up sitting on his lap) <br/>
CHAPEL: Sorry, sir. <br/>
SPOCK: Are you injured, Miss Chapel? <br/>
CHAPEL: No. No, I, I'm fine. Are you feeling all right? <br/>
SPOCK: Perfectly normal. I will append your summary to the report. Was
there something else, Miss Chapel? <br/>
CHAPEL: Wouldn't you like me to, well, stay? Help you? <br/>
SPOCK: That would be illogical, Miss Chapel. <br/>
CHAPEL: Yes. Yes, It'd be stupid. </font></p>

completely successful? <br/>
CHAPEL: Oh, no, it was. I made a complete fool of myself. <br/>
MUDD: But you know how cold Vulcans are. Perhaps it takes a bit more
time for Spock to <br/>
CHAPEL: You're the same fraud you've always been, Harry. I don't know
how I could have believed you. <br/>
MUDD: Well, let's discuss it rationally, my dear. Let's not be hasty. <br/>
CHAPEL: Don't panic, Harry. This phaser is set on stun, not kill.
Activate the intercom. <br/>
MUDD: Now wait a minute. Perhaps that particular crystal was defective.
Here, try another. I assure you <br/>
CHAPEL: Stop it! <br/>
(She fires, missing Harry but hitting the crystals, which then
evaporate into the ventilation system. Then she sets off the Red Alert.
Mudd overpowers her) <br/>

thought of any danger to her, to the woman I love. <br/>

MCCOY: Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: Yes. I want to protect her, hold her in my arms. <br/>

system grill. <br/>

Omega Cygni, I turned a handsome profit selling the natives their own
oceans. <br/>
CHAPEL: We haven't seen any traces of intelligent life. Of any life. <br/>
MUDD: Then you can relax. There's no danger, ay? We'll get you set up
top class. Don't bother to thank me. <br/>

Spock. Come, let's go get Mudd and Christine. <br/>

smashes the shuttlecraft. Three phasers make it annoyed. Then another

KIRK: I think we should get a few things straight. <br/>
SPOCK: Jim. No. Captain. We're both reacting to the drug. The love
potion. <br/>
MUDD: It worked? <br/>
KIRK: Yes, we have to control our emotional reactions. <br/>

Uhura. I've saved just about everybody on this here ship. If the
Enterprise had a heart, I'd save her too. Now, let's talk about your

I purchased the crystals from. <br/>

(The creatures are coming) <br/>
KIRK: Keep trying to contact the Enterprise. Maybe we can distract
them. <br/>
SPOCK: That is an outstandingly stupid idea. I'm sorry. The drug. I
simply doubt that we can appeal to their better nature. If they have
one. <br/>
