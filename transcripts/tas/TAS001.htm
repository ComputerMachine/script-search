Captain's log, stardate 5392.4. The Enterprise has been assigned to
escort two robot grain ships to Sherman's Planet, which has been struck
by crop failures and famine. This shipment of seed grain,
quintrotriticale, is necessary to the survival of the colonists. We are
breaking course to Sherman's Planet to investigate what appears to be a
Klingon battle cruiser pursuing some kind of smaller ship. Observation
may confirm a rumour that the Klingons have a new weapon, type so far
unknown. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SULU: Captain, it is a Klingon ship. Rapidly
closing on its target. <br/>
SPOCK: Sensors indicate the smaller vessel is a one-man scout ship of
common design. <br/>
SULU: They're firing on him. <br/>
(Explosions happen around the little ship) <br/>
KIRK: Klingon battle cruiser, identify yourself. Ahead, warp factor
six. Scotty, lock the transporter on that small vessel. We're going to
rescue that pilot. <br/>

KIRK: Arm all phasers. Deflector shields up. <br/>
SULU: Phasers armed. Shields up. <br/>

four seconds. It produces a most remarkable (the weapon hits)
disruption. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SULU: Our engines are dead. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, we have been hit by a kind of projected stasis field.
Our matter-antimatter generators are disabled. We are paralysed. <br/>
KIRK: Fire phasers. <br/>
SULU: The phasers don't work, sir. <br/>
SPOCK: The photon torpedoes will not respond, either. The stasis field
disables all higher-order field and warp functions. <br/>
UHURA: Well, we could always throw rocks. <br/>
SPOCK: This new Klingon weapon must be one of surprising power if it
can immobilize a starship. The energy drain on the Klingon ship would
be enormous. <br/>
KIRK: Scotty, did you get that pilot? <br/>
SCOTT [OC]: I got him in the beam, sir. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Transporter room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SCOTT: But I can't integrate him. The system's
been discoordinated. <br/>
UHURA: Captain, I have a message coming in, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Put it on the viewscreen. <br/>
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: Ah, Captain Kirk. <br/>
KIRK: Release my ship. <br/>
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: I'd be delighted to, Captain Kirk, if you will
turn over the pilot of the little ship. <br/>
KIRK: That ship was a Federation-built craft. The pilot is under our
protection. <br/>
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: He has committed ecological sabotage. If I have
to take him by force, I will. <br/>
KIRK: The first Klingon to step aboard this ship will be the last
Klingon. Full security alert, Mister Spock. <br/>
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid, Captain Kirk, you'll find your
phasers no longer work, nor any of your weapons. <br/>
UHURA: Mister Spock, I'm losing contact with our robot ships. They're
not held by the stasis field and they're moving out of range. <br/>
KIRK: What was that? Lieutenant, cut off that frequency. <br/>
UHURA: Yes, sir. (Koloth is cut off) The robot ships, they're moving
off. <br/>
KIRK: They still have power? We still control them? <br/>
SULU: Affirmative, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Bring them back, Mister Sulu. Have them ram the Klingon ship. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, you can't afford to lose that grain. <br/>
KIRK: I can afford even less to lose the Enterprise. Open the hailing
frequency again, Lieutenant. Captain Koloth. I'm going to give you one
last chance to release the Enterprise. <br/>
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: You're going to give me one chance? (he gets
the message about the ships) It won't work, Captain Kirk. <br/>
(transmission ends) <br/>
KIRK: It will work, or he'd still be gloating. Bring the robot ships in
from two different angles, Mister Sulu. <br/>
(The Klingons fire two more stasis beams) <br/>
SPOCK: Incredible. The amount of energy that field must require. <br/>
(The new beams fail to reach their targets, then they all fail and
Enterprise is free) <br/>
SPOCK: They couldn't maintain the stasis field. <br/>
KIRK: Keep your phasers locked on target, Mister Sulu. Hold your fire
until they fire first. <br/>
SULU: Aye, sir. Phasers locked on. <br/>
(The Klingons fire at a robot ship) <br/>
SPOCK: Apparently their battle capacity is down. They only damaged it. <br/>
SULU: They're veering off. <br/>
SPOCK: Sensors indicate their power cells are almost exhausted. They
probably don't have the strength for a prolonged battle now. <br/>
KIRK: Scotty, can you integrate that pilot now? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JONES: Captain Kirk. Friend Kirk. <br/>
KIRK: Seal off the area, Ensign. You know the law about transporting
animals proven harmful. <br/>
JONES: Captain, these are safe tribbles. <br/>
MCCOY: There's no such thing as a safe tribble. <br/>
SPOCK: A safe tribble would be a contradiction in terms. Tribbles are
well known for their proclivities in multiplication. <br/>
JONES: And they breed fast, too. And that's why these tribbles are
safe. They don't reproduce. <br/>
MCCOY: Don't reproduce? <br/>
JONES: I've had them genetically engineered for compatibility with
humanoid ecologies. See how friendly and loveable they are? And not a
baby in the bunch. They're great pets and profitable, too. <br/>
KIRK: Jones, how did you get away from Space Station K7? You were
supposed to clean up all the tribbles there. <br/>
JONES: Oh, well, I managed a short parole. I found some help. This is a
tribble predator. It's called a glommer. <br/>
(He holds up a pyramid-shaped thing with four legs, six horns and two
eyes on long stalks) <br/>
JONES: Watch. <br/>
(The glommer pounces over a tribble, and we don't get to see the
details) <br/>
MCCOY: Well, at least it's neat. <br/>
KIRK: Why were the Klingons chasing you, Jones? <br/>
JONES: How should I know? Klingons have notoriously bad tempers. <br/>
SPOCK: That may be true, but they rarely enter Federation space and
fire on Federation vessels without reason. <br/>
KIRK: They did mention ecological sabotage. <br/>
JONES: Me? A saboteur? Ridiculous. <br/>
KIRK: Captain Koloth was pretty emphatic. <br/>
JONES: It was such a little thing. I can't understand at all why they
got upset. <br/>
KIRK: What did you do? <br/>
JONES: I only sold them some tribbles. <br/>
KIRK: You sold tribbles on a Klingon planet? <br/>
JONES: Well, I didn't know it was a Klingon planet. <br/>
KIRK: Tribbles don't like Klingons. That should have given you some
clue. <br/>
JONES: Klingons like tribbles even less. It was lucky you came along
and saved me when you did, Friend Kirk. I couldn't have outrun them
much longer. <br/>
KIRK: According to our computer files, Jones, you are in violation of
three Federation mandates and forty seven local ones. You're confined
until we complete our mission. Then we'll turn you over to the proper
authorities. <br/>
JONES: Captain, couldn't we talk this over? I didn't think so. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MCCOY: Jim, Cyrano Jones is right. These tribbles
don't reproduce. They just get fat. I don't think we have anything to
worry about. <br/>
KIRK: Not about tribbles, anyway. I am concerned about that new Klingon
weapon. <br/>
SPOCK: It is an energy-sapping field of great strength, Captain. It
immobilizes a starship and its weapons capability. But apparently, it
also immobilizes the attacking ship's abilities at the same time. <br/>
SCOTT: Aye, and if that's true, then it's a weapon that leaves them as
helpless as it does us. <br/>
SPOCK: I believe I just said that, Mister Scott. <br/>
KIRK: The practical advantages of such a weapon would seem to be
limited. <br/>
SPOCK: Perhaps, but there are logical applications. The key question
is, how long does it take them to recharge? They will probably attack
us again as soon as they are back up to power. And they will probably
begin by destroying the other robot ship to prevent us from repeating
the same trick. They want Cyrano Jones very badly. <br/>
MCCOY: He really doesn't seem the saboteur type, Jim. <br/>
KIRK: Yes. Status report on the damaged grain ship, Scotty? <br/>
SCOTT: Well, sir, we've managed to transfer all the grain aboard, but
it severely limits us. We filled the shuttlecraft hangars, all our
extra holds, and we've even got containers of that wheat, that
quintrotriticale, in the corridors of the ship. And then we've got that
other robot ship to escort, too. I don't like it at all, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Nor do I, Mister Scott, but we've got to do it. Sherman's Planet
needs that grain desperately. <br/>
SCOTT: Aye, sir, but we've got tribbles on the ship, quintrotriticale
in the corridors, Klingons in the quadrant. It can ruin your whole day,
sir. <br/>
(And big fat pink tribbles are 'sniffing' around the containers. So big
and fat that the glommer cannot quite cope with them) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SPOCK: Captain, sensors are picking up a Klingon
battle cruiser. <br/>
KIRK: Deflector shields up. Stand by phasers. (rolls a tribble off his
chair) How fat do these things get? <br/>
SULU: Klingon ship approaching rapidly. Within phaser range in thirty
seconds. <br/>
SPOCK: Obviously, they can recharge their power in a matter of hours. <br/>
KIRK: Use the robot ship as a decoy. Have it change course and move
off. We'll use it again to give the Klingons trouble. They can't
control more than one ship at a time with their stasis field. <br/>
SULU: Beginning evasive manoeuvres. <br/>
SPOCK: The Klingon seems to be veering off. My mistake, Captain. They
were not veering off. They were attacking the grain ship. <br/>
SULU: But they didn't destroy it. They only wrecked the propulsion
units. They left the cargo intact. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain Koloth is quite a marksman. <br/>
SULU: They've changed course. They're coming in again. <br/>
KIRK: Ready phasers. <br/>
SULU: Phasers armed and ready, sir. <br/>
(The Klingons fire two shots at Enterprise. The shaking of the ship
makes some containers fall over and break open. Kirk returns fire, then
comes an attempt with the stasis beam. Meanwhile, little pink tribbles
are becoming giant pink tribbles.) <br/>
KIRK: Photon torpedoes. Fire one. <br/>
SPOCK: They're running away. Very odd. They did not use their stasis
weapon at all. <br/>
KIRK: Perhaps they haven't had enough time to recharge it. <br/>
SPOCK: Or the purpose of the attack was something else. <br/>
SULU: They disabled the robot ship. <br/>
KIRK: Scotty, put a tractor beam on it. We'll take it in tow. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, that could be exactly what they want us to do. Tow the
robot and limit our available power. We're carrying the extra mass of
the first ship's cargo, and now we have the second one in tow. That
requires a great deal of power we won't be able to use in battle. <br/>
KIRK: That seems logical. <br/>
SPOCK: Thank you. <br/>
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock, do you have any ideas? <br/>
SPOCK: We could always throw tribbles at them. <br/>
KIRK: I thought Vulcans didn't have a sense of humour. <br/>
SPOCK: We don't, Captain. <br/>
(The glommer looks like a jockey on the back of a tribble) <br/>
SCOTT: Captain, we've got broken cargo containers in all the corridors,
and the tribbles are eating the grain. <br/>
KIRK: Get Cyrano Jones up here. <br/>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Any sign of Captain Koloth's ship? <br/>
SULU: Nothing, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Keep scanning. <br/>
JONES: Captain Kirk, what can I do for you? Some Spican flame gems
perhaps? <br/>
KIRK: Your tribbles are all over my ship. My security men can't find
them all. <br/>
JONES: You need better security men, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Mister Jones, you are in enough trouble already. <br/>
JONES: Captain, a harmless little tribble. What can they hurt? <br/>
KIRK: Harmless, maybe. Little? (pushes a beach ball off his seat) In
any case, they're eating the quintrotriticale. <br/>
JONES: The what? <br/>
KIRK: The wheat! <br/>
JONES: They're hungry, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: So are the people on Sherman's Planet. A little tribble doesn't
eat much, a big tribble does. And these are growing. Jones, is this the
ecological sabotage the Klingons are so mad about? <br/>
SULU: Captain, the Klingons are coming back. <br/>
KIRK: Speak of the devil. <br/>
(McCoy enters) <br/>
MCCOY: Jim, there's something about these tribbles. <br/>
KIRK: Later, Bones. (pushes one nearly as big as himself off his chair)

later. Deflector shields up. Stand by photon torpedoes. And all
