Captain's log, stardate 5483.7. The Enterprise is en route through an
unfamiliar sector of space where a series of Earth Federation ships
have disappeared mysteriously during the last a hundred and fifty
years. Recent joint discussions with the Klingon and Romulan Empires
have revealed that a starship has disappeared in this sector precisely
every twenty seven point three four six star years. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SPOCK: If my calculations are correct, Captain, we
have twenty seconds to go. <br/>
KIRK: Twenty seconds to what? That's what worries me. Lieutenant Uhura,
place the ship on Yellow Alert. <br/>
UHURA: Aye, sir. Yellow Alert. <br/>
SPOCK: Five seconds. Four, three <br/>
UHURA: All stations report Yellow Alert status, sir. Captain, I'm
getting some sort of subspace radio signal. <br/>
KIRK: Put it on ship's speaker. <br/>
UHURA: It's more like music than a message. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, we are being probed. <br/>
KIRK: From where? Can you trace it? <br/>
SPOCK: The signal is coming from a star system twenty light years away.
<br/>
KIRK: Can you identify it? <br/>
SPOCK: It is the Taurean system. A small star at the extreme edge of
this sector. <br/>
KIRK: That's a powerful signal to reach here from that great a
distance. <br/>
SCOTT: It seems to be calling us. <br/>
KIRK: Strange. Yes, I get the same feeling myself. <br/>
SPOCK: It does resemble a summons. <br/>
UHURA: I find no resemblance to a summons, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Opinion noted. Set a course for the Taurean system, Lieutenant
Arex. Warp factor seven. <br/>
(Later) <br/>
CHAPEL: You wanted me, Lieutenant? Are you all right? <br/>
UHURA: I am. But I want you to observe the men here. It seemed to start
when we picked up that signal, and it's gotten worse. <br/>
SPOCK: Fascinating. Like a Vulcan marriage drum. I am experiencing
audio-visual suggestion, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: So am I. <br/>
(They are 'seeing' women with white hair) <br/>
KIRK: Dimensional visions. Any idea what's causing them, Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: Logically, we must assume they are created by the probe. <br/>
UHURA: Sir, what visions? We don't see anything. <br/>
KIRK: Miss Chapel, you don't see anything, either? <br/>
CHAPEL: No, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Take a medical reading, Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura, call Doctor
McCoy to the Bridge. <br/>
UHURA: Sickbay, Doctor McCoy. Please report to the Bridge. Doctor
McCoy? No response. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> UHURA: The signal's getting stronger, sir. <br/>
KIRK: Re-scan your sensor readings, Mister Spock. <br/>
SPOCK: Readings are still inconclusive. It is odd that only the men are
affected, Captain. I suggest <br/>
(A planet wobbles into view. and the men go all misty. The Enterprise
enters orbit) <br/>
SCOTT: Ship's log, stardate 5483.8. Engineering Officer Scott in
command. We are in orbit around planet two in the Taurean system.
Probes and sensors indicate there was once a vast civilisation here.
Lovely. Lovely. However, life readings are sparse and concentrated.
Captain Kirk is beaming down with a scouting party to investigate. <br/>
UHURA: These figures just don't match up with Spock's. So far I count
three sensor readings that are off. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A building that looks like frozen flames) <br/>
KIRK: Fantastic architecture. Only an incredibly advanced race could
have built it. <br/>
CARVER: You want all those routine readings, sir. <br/>
KIRK: No, I don't think so, Carver. Spock will do it. <br/>
MCCOY: There is something compelling about it. <br/>
KIRK: Yes, I feel it too, Bones. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, the urgency of our feeling suggests visual compulsion.
I advise remaining at a distance until I can determine the extent of
its influence. The life forms are indicated in its centre. <br/>
KIRK: There's no apparent danger, Spock. Let's go. </font></p>

beautiful white-haired, blue-eyed women.) <br/>
THEELA: They are here. <br/>
ALL: Oh, such wondrous ones. They honour us. <br/>
THEELA: I am Theela, the Head Female. Welcome, James Kirk, Doctor
McCoy, Mister Spock. Welcome. <br/>
(What, the redshirt is suddenly invisible? How rude.) <br/>
SPOCK: The form is humanoid, but there are many internal differences.
Their bodies appear to function on an unusual psychokinesis level. <br/>
MCCOY: First time I ever admired a body function. <br/>
KIRK: How do you know our names? <br/>
THEELA: The Opto-aud revealed you to us. <br/>
(She hums a note and a door slides back to reveal the Enterprise on a
viewscreen, including images of the Bridge) <br/>
SPOCK: Tonal control. Fascinating. <br/>
THEELA: The Opto-aud will reveal whatever is asked, Mister Spock. We
are grateful that you heard the signal, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: The signal? A distress call, wasn't it? <br/>
THEELA: I will explain its meaning later. We have prepared a feast to
celebrate your presence. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Captain's log, stardate 5483.9. The beauty of this
place is unequalled. It's the answer to all of man's dreams. Exquisite
in every way. We're here to investigate, to investigate... The women
radiate delight. </font></p>

MCCOY: These are the most beautiful women in the galaxy. But where are
the men? <br/>
THEELA: They occupy another compound. <br/>
KIRK: That makes sense. <br/>
WOMAN: Mister Spock. <br/>
(She throws something to him, he fails to catch it. It hits his chest
and he falls unconscious. Kirk tries to get up) <br/>
KIRK: Spock <br/>
(They all fall over) <br/>
THEELA: Take them to the slumber chambers. They must rest. <br/>
MCCOY: Probably that nectar. It's potent as Saurian brandy. <br/>

circlet around their heads. McCoy seems older) <br/>

seems more lined than usual. He tries to remove the circlet and fails) </font></p>

science teams. If there is an answer, it's here. <br/>
COMPUTER: Computer on. <br/>
CHAPEL: Summation of medical, biological, astrophysical scans. <br/>
COMPUTER: Working. Probe directed at ship from planet surface is
severely enervating to humanoid males. Exposure causes increasing
weakness. Possibly to point of death. <br/>
UHURA: Lieutenant Uhura to Security Officer Davison. <br/>
DAVISON [OC]: Davison here. <br/>
UHURA: I want an all-woman security team on every transporter
immediately. No one is to transport down to the planet unless it is on
my order. <br/>
DAVISON [OC]: Aye, aye, Lieutenant. <br/>
CHAPEL: What are you doing? <br/>
UHURA: Taking command of this ship. </font></p>

KIRK: Yes. Duties. That's it. Duties. I have <br/>
THEELA: You cannot leave, Mister Spock. You are needed here. Soon, all
the men on your ship will feel as you do. They are all needed, and they
will join us. <br/>
KIRK: We must go. <br/>
THEELA: Obstruct them. <br/>

UHURA: Mister Scott, as senior Lieutenant, I'm taking responsibility
for the safety of this ship. <br/>
SCOTT: Very thoughtful of you, love. <br/>
UHURA: Ship's log, supplemental. Lieutenant Uhura recording. Due to
Chief Engineering Officer Scott's euphoric state of mind, I am assuming
command of the Enterprise, I accept full responsibility for my action.
A detailed account will be recorded later. Nurse Chapel, until further
notice, you will act as Chief Medical Officer. <br/>
CHAPEL: Yes, Lieutenant. </font></p>

SPOCK: Yes. Your medikit, Doctor. It may contain something which will
help us. <br/>
MCCOY: I wonder why they let me keep it. <br/>
SPOCK: Perhaps they saw no practical use in it. <br/>
MCCOY: Cortropine. Could help. It's a strong stimulant. <br/>
KIRK: Go ahead. <br/>
(At the door) <br/>
KIRK: Locked. <br/>
SPOCK: (with a medical scanner) If the lock is magnetised, this may
disrupt its field. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> THEELA [OC]: Come. They might have returned to
where they landed. <br/>
KIRK: The headbands. Look at them. <br/>
SPOCK: I have noticed that their glow diminishes when the women are not
present. They could be polarised conductors which transfer our vital
energy to the bodies of the women. <br/>
KIRK: You mean they're actually draining our life forces? <br/>
SPOCK: That would account for our rapid aging, Captain. And our
weakness. If you recall, the women seemed listless at first. But as our
strength has failed, they have become more energetic and vital. <br/>
KIRK: How long do we have, Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: We seem to be aging ten years per day, Captain. <br/>
MCCOY: Ten years? In four days, we'll be dead! <br/>
KIRK: And useless to them. Theela said the other men of the crew would
join us here. They'll be lured into the same trap. We've got to contact
the ship. <br/>
SPOCK: I have retained more strength than any of you. My internal
structure is different, Captain, my life span longer. It is wiser if I
go to the temple to try and find the communicators and contact the
ship. </font></p>

THEELA: The past. Reveal it. <br/>
(Images appear - first male and female) <br/>
THEELA: This is the race from whom we are descended. They came to this
planet when our homeworld began to die. They built this place and all
surrounding it. They did not know this planet drains humanoid energy.
But the women's bodies developed a glandular secretion, enabling them
to survive and to manipulate certain areas of the males' brains,
influence their emotional senses. Ultimately, it drained the men,
caused them to weaken and die. <br/>
(Meanwhile, the urn is filling up with water, and the men can't get
out) <br/>
THEELA: To survive, we must vitalise each twenty seven years of your
time. <br/>
WOMAN: Instead, we are eternal prisoners. We neither age nor die. We
are unable even to bear children. <br/>
UHURA: What about Captain Kirk and the others? Can the Opto-aud locate
them? <br/>
THEELA: We shall see. The men of the Enterprise, reveal them. <br/>
(It does) <br/>
UHURA: They're drowning! Where are they? <br/>
THEELA: The nearest water accumulation is many cusecs from here. <br/>

CHAPEL: No results, Captain. We've tried everything we know. <br/>
SPOCK: Perhaps the transporter is the key. <br/>
MCCOY: Key to what? <br/>
SPOCK: Our restoration. It holds the molecular pattern of our original
bodies when we beamed down to the planet. <br/>
KIRK: Spock. Can the transporter be programmed to re-pattern us as we
were? <br/>
SPOCK: Possibly. But the odds against us are ninety nine point seven to
one. </font></p>
