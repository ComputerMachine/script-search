Captain's log, stardate 5683.1. We're making a rendezvous with the
Vedala asteroid on a unique mission. The Vedala are the oldest space
faring race we know. They say something incredibly dangerous to the
safety of our galaxy is developing and they have sent for selected
specialists, including Spock and myself. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Transporter room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: Maintain the Enterprise in this position,
Sulu. If Spock and I survive, we'll return here. If not, Mister Scott,
you have your orders. Energise. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest glade]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Five other people are already there. A tall
golden bird man, a light green insectoid, a feline, a humanoid female
and a Lizard. The forest is purple-barked trees, giant fungi and red
shrubs. The ground is blue) <br/>
VEDALA: (feline) Welcome, Captain James Kirk and Commander Spock. I
will introduce you. First, Tchar. (Gold bird) Hereditary prince of the
Skorr, master of the eerie. Sord. (Reptile) <br/>
EM3GREEN: (insectoid) I was sentenced to this mad expedition. My people
are cautious, what you would call cowards. <br/>
VEDALA: As an expert lockpick and thief, you are welcome. Em3green.
Lara (the female) is a hunter. She has a flawless directional sense, a
necessary skill where you are going. Mister Spock was chosen for his
analytical mind and scientific expertise. Captain Kirk for his
leadership and adaptability. Tchar will explain your mission. <br/>
TCHAR: Two centuries past, my people, the Skorr, were great warriors.
We had advanced military technology and we could breed vast armies
rapidly. But today we are a civilised people because of Alar. (makes a
gesture) <br/>
KIRK: A religious leader, was he not? <br/>
TCHAR: Our salvation and our teacher. He brought us peace. He made us
great. He died, and we made him immortal. <br/>
VEDALA: Alar's brain patterns were recorded before his death, in a
piece of indurite sculpture. <br/>
TCHAR: Our Soul, the Soul of the Skorr, was stolen. <br/>
VEDALA: The theft triggered a racial fury in the Skorr. They are
preparing for war. <br/>
KIRK: Against whom? <br/>
TCHAR: The known galaxy. <br/>
SPOCK: It is a very real threat. In two standard years, the existing
Skorr could breed an army of two hundred billion warriors. <br/>
TCHAR: My government fears this, so the theft of the Soul of Alar has
been kept secret. But we must recover it before my people discover it
gone and go mad, launch a jihad, a holy war on the galaxy. <br/>
KIRK: Who took the Soul? <br/>
VEDALA: Unknown. The motive, as Tchar has said, to provoke a holy war. <br/>
SPOCK: Is there any clue to its location? <br/>
VEDALA: A mad planet, Geologically unstable. Constant earthquakes,
gravitic shifts, tidal waves. The temperature varies from twenty Kelvin
to two hundred and four above. Somewhere on that planet, the Soul of
Alar is hidden. Three expeditions have tried to recover it. Three
expeditions have been lost. You are the next, if you agree. <br/>
KIRK: The Vedala are a powerful race. Why haven't your people retrieved
the Soul? <br/>
VEDALA: My people could not survive on that planet. You have a chance. <br/>
KIRK: We agree. <br/>
VEDALA: Then it is done. <br/>
(She vanishes) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Barren planet]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The adventurers are gathered around an open
vehicle. The ground is flat with occasional faceted crystal rocks) <br/>
TCHAR: I cannot feel the Soul. We are nowhere near it. <br/>
SPOCK: That is to be expected. The surface of this planet shifts
constantly. Even the Vedala are not certain where the Soul is. <br/>
KIRK: It has directional equipment that keys on indurite. <br/>
SORD: I like this place, it's got variety. <br/>
EM3GREEN: I can handle the machine. <br/>
SPOCK: Our direction is indicated. <br/>
EM3GREEN: It's phasing, unfocusing. <br/>
(The directional indicator blows up) <br/>
KIRK: Why did the Vedala call this the Mad planet? <br/>
LARA: Means nothing. I can tell the way. That way. <br/>
TCHAR: Are you certain, human? <br/>
LARA: For sure, birdman. I can't get lost. I can't be fooled about
directions. That's why I'm here. <br/>
SPOCK: The Vedala would not have chosen Lara if her abilities were less
than perfect. <br/>
KIRK: Agreed, but we're forced to travel on the ground. I want an
overview. <br/>
TCHAR: I will scout overhead. <br/>
(Tchar flies off) <br/>
SPOCK: The Vedala will have been efficient in equipping us. I will
acquaint myself with our supplies. <br/>
LARA: Vulcans. Never liked them much myself. Cold-blooded critters, all
of them. <br/>
KIRK: I wouldn't say that. Mister Spock is a unique personality. <br/>
LARA: But not human like you and me. Maybe you got different customs.
My world there's a lot of females, not so many men. Come we find a man
attractive, we say so. I'm saying so. How do you find me? <br/>
KIRK: Fascinating. But we're not here on a pleasure trip, Lara. <br/>
LARA: All the more reason to take what pleasure there might be in it. <br/>
SPOCK: I have checked the supplies, Captain. As expected, they are
adequate and there are weapons. <br/>
KIRK: Against what? There's no life on this planet. <br/>
SPOCK: But there is, Captain. Ourselves. And there may be other things
guarding the Soul of Alar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They are driving through a rain storm) <br/>
LARA: Real weather. <br/>
KIRK: And a half. <br/>
(Then suddenly the rain stops, the sun comes out and a volcano erupts
in the distance) <br/>
EM3GREEN: We'll all die here. <br/>
SPOCK: A statistical probability. <br/>
LARA: You ever quote anything besides statistics, Vulcan? <br/>
SPOCK: Yes. But philosophy and poetry are not appropriate here. <br/>
TCHAR: I can see something. (lands on a cliff) I can sense it, the Soul
of Alar is there. <br/>
(There is a golden glow from an obvious construction) <br/>
LARA: Something's coming. <br/>
SPOCK: A lava flow. Volcanic action is to be expected. <br/>
LARA: Never mind that. You got to get us out of here. <br/>
KIRK: We might be able to divert the lava flow with a barricade. Tchar,
get us a visual estimate! <br/>
SPOCK: Such a diversion would be of short duration, Captain. And I must
point out, the vehicle lacks sufficient speed to escape. <br/>
KIRK: Not if we used all of the power pack's energy for one high speed
run. <br/>
SPOCK: It is possible, but the rewiring of the power leads is complex
and time-consuming. <br/>
EM3GREEN: I could do it, if you can diagram the schematics, sir. <br/>
SPOCK: Yes, quickly then. Terminal M3 red, lead to diode shunt A37.
Cross connect to A14. <br/>
TCHAR: Kirk. There is a ravine sixty metres to your left. If it can be
blocked, the lava will flow past those rocks to one side. <br/>
KIRK: Got it. Sord. <br/>
SORD: I heard him. <br/>
SPOCK: Carefully, Em. One missed connection could destroy us. <br/>
EM3GREEN: I know. I'm trying to be careful. <br/>
(Kirk, Sord and Lara push boulders off the cliff and create a rock fall
to block the ravine. <br/>
LARA: I figure we've bought ourselves a little time. Few minutes. <br/>
SPOCK: It's re-rigged. Hurry. <br/>
(They rush back to the transport as the lava comes over the top of the
barrier) <br/>
SORD: Come on, insect, move it. <br/>
LARA: Twenty one degrees east. Fifty metres to get out of the flow
path. <br/>
TCHAR: Hurry. <br/>
KIRK: Go. <br/>
(They race ahead of the red hot molten rock until they hit an
obstruction and Spock is thrown from the vehicle) <br/>
SPOCK: Leave, all of you. <br/>
(Kirk runs back for him) <br/>
KIRK: Not without you. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, you must get the others away. <br/>
KIRK: We're all getting away. <br/>
(The vehicle stalls on a shale slope, and they get out and up to
safety) <br/>
LARA: Close. <br/>
SPOCK: Far too close, Captain. I appreciate your action on my behalf,
but your first duty is to the group and the mission. <br/>
KIRK: Quite right, Spock. And that responsibility includes not losing
the best science officer in Starfleet. <br/>
SORD: You two going to argue honours, or are we going to get on with
it? <br/>
(A snowstorm starts up) <br/>
LARA: Oh! And I was just going to ask, what next? <br/>
KIRK: We move on. <br/>
EM3GREEN: The power pack is burned out. <br/>
KIRK: We'll have to carry the equipment. <br/>
(Once again, Tchar flies off to scout ahead) <br/>
KIRK: Anything? <br/>
TCHAR: Wait. Yes, yes! <br/>
(He sees the building. Then the ground opens under Em3Green and he
nearly falls into a ravine. Tchar lifts him back on land) <br/>
EM3GREEN: I can't go any farther. I'm not even afraid anymore. Just
very tired. <br/>
LARA: Come on, Em, a bit more. <br/>
EM3GREEN: No. I'm finished. <br/>
KIRK: Sorry, Em. We'll be needing you. Sord. <br/>
EM3GREEN: Let me go. <br/>
SORD: Hang on. (Picks him up and carries him) <br/>
TCHAR: I'll go ahead. <br/>
(Further on) <br/>
KIRK: What is it? <br/>
SORD: Not sure. Thought I saw something move in the brush. <br/>
SPOCK: There is no life on this planet. <br/>
SORD: Guess you're right. This planet just gets on your nerves. <br/>
TCHAR: I can sense the Soul. I will fly ahead, examine the building,
and meet you on the way. <br/>
KIRK: Tchar, be careful. We need you, too. <br/>
(Tchar flies off) <br/>
KIRK: We're tired, sore, hurt and angry, but we're also just about
there. I'll scout ahead. Everybody else stay together, keep moving. <br/>
LARA: I'll go with you. Remember, scouting's my job. By rights, I
should be doing it alone. <br/>
(Kirk and Lara run off) <br/>
SPOCK: Sord, what did you think you saw back there? <br/>
SORD: Don't know, Vulcan. A shape, couldn't really make it out.
Probably seeing things, like Kirk figures. <br/>
SPOCK: There should be no life on this planet. <br/>
EM3GREEN: You keep saying that. <br/>
SPOCK: Yes. The Vedala would have informed us if there were any live
beings here we should know of. <br/>
SORD: Maybe the Vedala didn't know about it. <br/>
SPOCK: That is an impossibility. <br/>
SORD: Think so? I'm not so sure. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Near the building]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (There is no snow here) <br/>
KIRK: That's it. End of a long, hard journey. <br/>
LARA: We still have to go back, James. I tell you true, I find you an
attractive man. If we were together, the trip would be easier. And if
anything happened, why, we'd have some green memories. <br/>
KIRK: I already have a lot of green memories. <br/>
LARA: Oh. <br/>
KIRK: Maybe some other time, Lara. We still have our work cut out for
us here. <br/>
(The rest of the group have arrived) <br/>
SPOCK: Is this not the shape of your people's primitive temples? <br/>
TCHAR: Yes. The entrance should be (he points). Can you open it? <br/>
EM3GREEN: There is no lock I can't pick. <br/>
(He gets to work with all six arms) <br/>
KIRK: What is it? <br/>
EM3GREEN: I'm opening the locks. <br/>
LARA: Wonderful. <br/>
EM3GREEN: No. They're on a timed trigger. If I don't get all the locks
open quickly enough, it explodes. <br/>
(A group of purple flying dragons attack) <br/>
SORD: Keep working. I'll cover you. <br/>
(Kirk and Lara shoot the dragons, and they explode) <br/>
KIRK: They're mechanical. <br/>
SPOCK: The Vedala were right. There are no living creatures here, only
the mechanised sentinels. <br/>
SORD: Hurry, small one. <br/>
(Kirk stops Spock from firing at the dragon attacking Tchar) <br/>
KIRK: We'll hit Tchar. <br/>
LARA: What happened to Tchar? <br/>
KIRK: There's no way to tell from here. The mechanical exploded. We
can't reach the roof from the outside. We'll have to try to get to him
from the interior. <br/>
EM3GREEN: Done. <br/>
(The doors open) <br/>
KIRK: We could rest awhile. Lara? <br/>
LARA: No. We've come this far. <br/>
SORD: Let's finish it. Or give this deadfall a chance to finish us. <br/>
SPOCK: I too would prefer to press on, Captain. The mechanicals on
guard may be what Sord saw tracking us earlier. Or there may be others.
In either case, it would be more advantageous to avoid another
encounter. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Temple]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (An object is hanging in mid-air, glowing) <br/>
SORD: Pretty. How do we reach it? <br/>
SPOCK: The walls are not climbable. <br/>
KIRK: Not without special equipment, which we don't have. Either we
find a way to reach it from here, or we fail. <br/>
(The door closes behind them) <br/>
EM3GREEN: No lock on the inside. We are prisoners. <br/>
KIRK: That's right. <br/>
LARA: You're not exactly surprised. <br/>
KIRK: Three previous expeditions tried and were lost. The planet is a
natural trap, but that's not enough. <br/>
SPOCK: You suggest sabotage, Captain? <br/>
KIRK: Yes, from inside each expedition. Remember Spock, you were the
one who said there are no life forms here except ourselves. <br/>
EM3GREEN: One of us? <br/>
KIRK: It's likely. <br/>
SPOCK: Approximately eighty two point five percent in favour of the
possibility. <br/>
KIRK: But it doesn't matter if we reach the Soul. Apparently the others
didn't get this far. <br/>
(He spots a ledge around the inside of the building, and jumps up to
it. The others join him, except) <br/>
SORD: I'm not built for that sort of thing. I'll wait for you down
here. <br/>
(As they inch along the foot-deep ledge, there is a quake) <br/>
SPOCK: The planet is geologically unstable. This structure is
inherently flexible, enabling it to withstand earthquakes. <br/>
EM3GREEN: It can, but what about us? <br/>
KIRK: Look. <br/>
EM3GREEN: We can almost reach it. <br/>
LARA: Maybe I can get a line on it. <br/>
SPOCK: It is locked in a force field. Your rope would merely bounce off
it. <br/>
KIRK: Spock, will our combined phasers disrupt the field? <br/>
SPOCK: I cannot define the field's energy base, Captain, but <br/>
(An energy weapon blasts a hole in the wall near them) <br/>
KIRK: The last piece of sabotage. I know who you are. A thousand feet
up, no method of reaching the Soul, except by air, by flight. Tchar. <br/>
(The golden birdman comes down and hovers) <br/>
LARA: Tchar. In the name of the Seven Gods, why? <br/>
KIRK: You stole this. You'll start a bloody crusade across the galaxy.
Tell us why, Tchar. <br/>
TCHAR: The Skorr were a warrior race. Now what are we? Slaves to the
illusion of peace. Cowards, soft in our comfort. This sick dream has
stolen our souls. I am Tchar, hereditary prince of the Skorr, leader of
battles. I will lead my people into glory, to avenge our history. <br/>
SPOCK: Most of them will be killed. The warrior races of the Federation
will rise up to battle the Skorr. <br/>
TCHAR: Yes. A noble death to win a great dream. We will live no longer
like worms crawling in the dirt. We will conquer. You will die. But you
have my respect. You fought well. You die in grace. <br/>
(They all start to float upwards) <br/>
EM3GREEN: He's turned on a gravity neutraliser in the building. <br/>
TCHAR: Now you can fly and fight as a Skorr. <br/>
SORD: No offence, little ones, but let me tackle him. <br/>
KIRK: Not in free fall. <br/>
EM3GREEN: Use your phaser on him. <br/>
KIRK: Too risky. He controls the fortress phaser bank, and they're set
on kill. No, it has to be on his terms. Spock, how long since you've
worked out in null-gravity combat exercises? <br/>
SPOCK: Last week with you, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Let's go. <br/>
(They push off from the walls and manage to grab Tchar by his wings.
Then Kirk hooks his into the Soul) <br/>
KIRK: Call for retrieval, now. <br/>
(Lara presses a button) <br/>
TCHAR: Let me die. <br/>
KIRK: You're going back with us. <br/>
(They all vanish in a golden haze) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest glade]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Soul is in the middle of the group. Tchar is
in a transparent box) <br/>
VEDALA: We give you thanks. The Soul of Alar is returned to his people.
<br/>
KIRK: What about Tchar? How are you going to punish him? <br/>
VEDALA: He will be healed of his madness. He is proud, brave. That he
will remain, but he will also be sane and whole again. (Tchar vanishes)
We cannot reward you. For the good of the Skorr, this must be forever
secret. You have only our thanks. <br/>
SORD: Got nowhere to keep a medal, anyway. But there'll be questions. <br/>
VEDALA: No. You will return and you will see, there will be no
questions, no medals, only our thanks. And in time, even the memory
will be gone from you. <br/>
LARA: Goodbye, James Kirk. Too bad. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SULU: Captain. Mister Spock, what happened? <br/>
KIRK: What do you mean? <br/>
SULU: You transported over and came right back. Did they call it off? <br/>
SPOCK: How long were we gone? <br/>
SULU: Long? About two minutes, I guess. I don't understand. <br/>
KIRK: The Vedala changed their minds. The danger is past. Back to your
stations. We have a lot of other places to go. </font> </p>
