Captain's log, stardate 3183.3. Our present mission, a routine
geological survey of type four asteroids, is nearing completion. The
cruise has been uneventful and we are now approaching the final
asteroid in our assigned sector, a full seventy two hours ahead of
schedule. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (As they approach the asteroid, three Romulan
warships become visible, and Enterprise is attacked) <br/>
KIRK: Scotty, give us maximum shielding. <br/>
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, bring us about to a new heading of nine oh two mark
six. <br/>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. Mister Spock, who the devil's attacking us? <br/>
SPOCK: Romulans, Captain. They were apparently lying in wait on the far
side of that asteroid. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SCOTT: A cold-blooded ambush. Let's give the
heathens a fight they won't soon forget. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: Negative. We've suffered damage and we're
outnumbered three to one. I think this is an instance where discretion
is the better part of valour. <br/>
UHURA: Captain, I've established contact with the Romulan commander. <br/>
KIRK: I demand an explanation for this unprovoked attack. <br/>
COMMANDER [on viewscreen]: Unprovoked? My dear Captain, your ship
trespassed into Romulan territory, in defiance of your own treaty. We
had no choice but to defend ourselves. <br/>
KIRK: We came nowhere near Romulan territory. I deny all charges and
plan to file a detailed complaint with the Federation. <br/>
COMMANDER [on viewscreen]: You seem to forget that invasion of Romulan
territory is punishable by death. <br/>
(More weapons hits) <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, the Romulan ships are overtaking us. At close range our
deflectors will be unable to repel their attack. <br/>
SULU: Captain Kirk! An unidentified energy field is drifting into our
path. <br/>
SPOCK: Strange. It's not on the charts. <br/>
KIRK: But it may be just what we need to shake the Romulans. Batten
down, we're going through. <br/>
(Enterprise sails into a foggy area with electrical discharges) <br/>
KIRK: Mister Spock, what are our chances? <br/>
SPOCK: The field is composed of highly charged subatomic particles. If
the density grows no worse we should be able to ride it out. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Enterprise emerges from the other side) <br/>
SULU: It worked. The Romulans turned back rather than risk the energy
field. <br/>
KIRK: Reduce speed to sub warp cruise. We'll lay by here for repairs. <br/>
UHURA: After that ride, I could use some repairs. </font></p>

dessert still on the table, and drinking glasses that look like some
vases I've got) <br/>
KIRK: How are the repairs progressing, Scotty? <br/>
SCOTT: Just fine, Captain. We should be in tip-top shape in another
twenty four hours, no thanks to those Romulan vultures. <br/>
MCCOY: Nevertheless, we're still in business and I propose a toast to a
narrow escape. <br/>
UHURA: Cheers! <br/>
KIRK: Salud! <br/>
UHURA: To us. <br/>
SULU: He, this glass just leaked all over me. <br/>
UHURA: How do you like that? So did mine. <br/>
SCOTT: And mine. <br/>
SPOCK: It appears we're all victims of a rather bizarre coincidence.
The odds against something like this happening are astronomical. <br/>
MCCOY: What coincidence? We used to pull stunts like this in medical
school with trick glasses. Don't look now, but we've got a practical
joker in our midst. <br/>
KIRK: Now let's not jump to conclusions, Bones. Yes, we all got wet, so
what's the joke? <br/>
SCOTT: Twas probably a minor slip-up of the food synthesisers. I'll
check it out after lunch. <br/>
KIRK: Fine. Right now why don't we all eat up before our food gets
cold. <br/>
(But before the fork reaches his lips, it bends and the food slides
off) <br/>
MCCOY: Another coincidence, Jim? <br/>
KIRK: I'm beginning to wonder, Bones, I am beginning to wonder. </font></p>

have continued to plague our crew. Even the perceptive Mister Spock has

useful function, and <br/>

SCOTT: No thanks, Arex. I'm just going to grab a sandwich and get me
back to work. <br/>
AREX: Very good. <br/>
SCOTT: One grilled cheese on rye. What the blazes? Hold it just a
doggone minute! <br/>
(All sorts of foods are being thrown from the dispenser and piling up
around his feet) <br/>
SCOTT: I said one sandwich, that's all. Someone turn off this infernal
food factory. <br/>
M'RESS: Excuse me for laughing, but <br/>
SCOTT: Go ahead and laugh. Big joke. I'll bet you two are responsible
for this, ay? <br/>

as I <br/>

AREX: Sir? <br/>
KIRK: I've just picked up my clean uniforms from the service chute and
when I put this one on, I discovered this. <br/>
(In big bold letters on his back - Kirk is a Jerk. The comm. system
bursts into laughter) <br/>
KIRK: When you all finish laughing, I'd appreciate an explanation. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, I never laugh. <br/>
KIRK: Well somebody certainly did. <br/>

than that. <br/>

KIRK: And it was almost covered with us. I don't know what's going on
here, but it's going to stop before someone's hurt. <br/>
(laughter from the comm. system)<br/>
KIRK: There's that laugh again. Something awfully familiar about it.
What do you make of all this, Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: The evidence all points to one guilty party, Captain. <br/>
KIRK: You mean you know who's behind these stunts? <br/>
SPOCK: Not who, what. I believe our practical joker is the Enterprise
itself. <br/>
KIRK: Of course. That laugh, it's the voice of our main computer. <br/>
SPOCK: Precisely. <br/>

KIRK: Did I hear that right? <br/>
SPOCK: Affirmative. The dysfunction is more severe than I thought.
Question. Are you deliberately holding our missing crewmembers
prisoner? <br/>

programmed to obey any direct order I may give, correct? <br/>

to believe it's kidnapped three of our crew. <br/>

COMPUTER: My circuits! You tricked me, Kirk. How could you? <br/>
MCCOY: What the devil is going on? <br/>
KIRK: Bones, the worst thing you can do to a practical joker is to play
a practical joke on them. <br/>
COMPUTER: It's not fair. <br/>
(Enterprise leaves the energy field) <br/>
SULU: The controls are responding now. <br/>
SPOCK: And I'm getting normal function in all computer modes. That last
pass through the energy field apparently reversed all effects. <br/>
MCCOY: Well done, Jim. <br/>
UHURA: Captain, I'm picking up strange transmissions from the Romulan
warships. Listen. <br/>
ROMULAN [OC]: Turn off those food synthesisers! We're knee deep in
desserts and they're still pouring out! <br/>
MCCOY: Shall we tell them how they can reverse the effects of the
field, Jim? <br/>
KIRK: Yes, but later. Let's not spoil their fun just yet. </font>
