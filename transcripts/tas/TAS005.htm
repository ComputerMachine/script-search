Captain's log, stardate 5143.3. While patrolling the edge of the
Romulan Neutral Zone, the Enterprise has changed course to assist a
one-man vessel which has fallen victim to a meteor swarm. Sensors
indicate the occupant is still alive. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: Have you identified the vessel, Mister
Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: Yes Captain, but you may find it difficult to believe. The
vessel is registered to Carter Winston. <br/>
MCCOY: That's impossible, Spock. Carter Winston's been missing over
five years. <br/>
(Kyle beams aboard a fair-haired man) <br/>
MCCOY: Incredible. It is him. <br/>
KIRK: Carter Winston. <br/>
CARTER: It seems you gentlemen know me. <br/>
KIRK: There are few in the Federation who wouldn't recognise your face,
sir. I'm Captain James Kirk, commanding this vessel. Mister Spock, my
first officer, Doctor McCoy, senior medical officer. <br/>
MCCOY: I'm especially honoured to meet you, Mister Winston. My daughter
was going to school on Cerberus about ten years ago when the crop
failure occurred. The entire population would've starved, Jim, if
Winston here hadn't used his personal fortune to bring in enough food
and goods to carry them through the crisis. <br/>
KIRK: One of the many stories I've heard about you, Mister Winston.
It's an honour for all of us to have you aboard. <br/>
SPOCK: There is one person aboard who should be especially happy to
learn you are alive, Mister Winston. Lieutenant Anne Nored of our
security detail. <br/>
CARTER: My fiancee? Anne's aboard this starship? <br/>
SPOCK: We will notify her as soon as we've verified your credentials,
Mister Winston. If you have your identity tapes with you <br/>
MCCOY: Spock! Of all the cold-blooded, inhospitable requests I've ever
heard. <br/>
SPOCK: I believe our regulations are quite clear, Doctor. An immediate
identity check and medical examination are a standard requirement at
this point. <br/>
KIRK: Spock is right as usual, Bones. <br/>
CARTER: And I understand, of course. My credentials, Captain. </font></p>

MCCOY: This instrument seems a little off. I've never gotten quite this
reading from a human before. <br/>
CARTER: Are you suggesting I'm not quite human, Doctor? <br/>
MCCOY: Of course not. Anyway, it's just a fraction off normal. It's
probably the instrument. They need to be recalibrated every so often. <br/>

CHAPEL: The Captain is inquiring if the examination is completed,
Doctor. <br/>
MCCOY: Yes, I suppose so. <br/>
CHAPEL: And Lieutenant Nored is waiting to see Mister Winston once
you've certified his medical condition. <br/>
MCCOY: Well, I certainly don't want to keep you any longer from your
fiancee. Show her in. <br/>
(McCoy and Chapel leave, and a brunette enters) <br/>
ANNE: Oh, Carter. <br/>
CARTER: I'm sorry, Anne. I never thought we would meet again. <br/>
ANNE: Carter, what is it? <br/>
CARTER: When I left on that last trip, I fully intended to come back
and marry you, but my ship was disabled and I crashed on Vendor. I'm
told I was lucky I survived. <br/>
ANNE: But you did survive. You're alive, and we're together again. <br/>
CARTER: Anne, I'm changed. First there was surgery, skin graft,
regrowth of bone. After they put me together, they assigned one of
their people to me, and he nursed me back to health. <br/>
ANNE: But, you said you've changed. How? I don't see any change. <br/>
CARTER: It's over between us, Anne. I'm sorry, I can't explain why but,
I can't marry you. Ever. </font></p>

CARTER: I've been down to examine my ship. They stowed it in the
shuttlebay. <br/>
KIRK: Yes, I'm afraid it's pretty badly damaged. It's hardly worth
salvaging right now. I've had our engineering officer, Mister Scott,
examine it and make a report. It's here somewhere. He doesn't think
there's anything left in your ship except scrap value. <br/>
(Behind his back, Carter Winston crosses his arms and glows, then turns
into a an orange creature poised on six slender tendrils. It drapes a
tendril around Kirk's shoulder. He falls unconscious and the thing
places him gently on his bed. Then the creature turns into James Kirk.)

these instruments, Doctor. They check out, but the readings are still
slightly off. What about the rest of the tests on Winston? <br/>
MCCOY: Well, some are off and some aren't. It has to be our error. Come
on. We'll start from the beginning and this time we're going to find
the answer. </font></p>

KIRK: Mister Sulu, lay in a direct course for Ratar Three. <br/>
SULU: Through the Romulan Neutral Zone, sir? <br/>
KIRK: That was the order, helmsman. <br/>
SULU: But sir, if we're caught there, the Romulans can confiscate the
ship. The treaty <br/>
KIRK: I know the terms of the treaty, Mister Sulu, and I believe you
heard my order. <br/>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. <br/>
SPOCK: Captain, the extreme long-range sensors show something in the
Zone. At this distance, I cannot determine precisely what it is. It
could be a trading vessel like Winston's. But it does not seem prudent
to take the risk of trespass into the Zone. <br/>
KIRK: Mister Spock, I've spoken to Winston on this at some length. He
has assured me it is absolutely vital to get to Ratar Three in the
shortest possible time. The survival of the entire planetary population
may depend on it. <br/>
SPOCK: An admirable mission, Captain, but if we endanger our ship <br/>
KIRK: I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't feel it safe, Spock.
Winston says his sensors detected no Romulans when he came through the
Zone last week. I'm satisfied he's telling the truth, and his word is
considered good. Isn't it? <br/>
SPOCK: That has been his reputation. <br/>

SPOCK: Perhaps you needed the rest. We are on course through the
Neutral Zone, sir. <br/>
KIRK: The Neutral Zone? We have no authorisation to enter it. Did you
order a course change, Spock? <br/>
SPOCK: No, sir. You did. <br/>
KIRK: Ridiculous. No captain of the Starfleet would do that unless it
was a matter of life and death. <br/>

ANNE: I don't know, Doctor. I just thought. Well, I have to talk to
someone. <br/>
MCCOY: Oh now, let me guess. It's you and Carter Winston. He told me a
little about it when I examined him. <br/>
ANNE: Doctor, what do I do? I still love him. <br/>
MCCOY: Well, I'm sure he'd like to feel the same way about you, Anne,
but that may be impossible. Five years, that's a long time. People
change. <br/>
ANNE: I haven't. What can I do? <br/>
MCCOY: Well, if he asked you to forget him, I think you should try to
do just that. Do you think he'd want to deceive you? <br/>
ANNE: Oh no. He's the gentlest, most thoughtful man I've ever known. <br/>
MCCOY: Yes, but, my dear, if he doesn't want you and he has asked you
to forget him, then I suggest you take that as an honest concern for
you and do it. Forget Winston. <br/>

ANNE: Thank you, Doctor. I'll consider your advice. (leaves) <br/>
MCCOY: What can I do for you, Captain? <br/>
KIRK: I want a complete medical examination, Bones. Something's just
happened <br/>

many tests to process right now. <br/>

MCCOY: That one's done. Tested out normal. <br/>

MCCOY: Well, there's always that possibility. I'll go over them again
if you like. <br/>

KIRK: All right, Winston. You can come out now. I suggest you show
yourself, Winston, or whatever you are. <br/>
MCCOY: Did you say I'm a man of curious habits? Jim's talking to a

KIRK: There used to be only two examining tables in this room. Now
there are three. <br/>

almost anything but this crystal. If you've never seen it work, I'll
demonstrate on you. <br/>
(The table transforms into the alien) <br/>
MCCOY: I saw that, but I don't believe it. <br/>
SPOCK: A Vendorian, Doctor. Their planet is quarantined, and few people
ever do see them. Their ability to rearrange their molecular structure
into anything with the same general size and mass and their practise of
deceit as a way of life puts them off limits. <br/>

ANNE [OC]: No progress yet. We have all decks patrolled, but no one has
seen him. <br/>

Spock. That wreck of Winston's ship was the bait to get a Romulan spy
onboard. And what better spy than a Vendorian who can shape at will.

ALIEN: It seems, Captain, that I am more Carter Winston than I knew. He
loved life. He loved Anne. I couldn't allow the Romulans to harm any of
you because of him. <br/>
KIRK: I understand. <br/>
ALIEN: What will happen to me now? <br/>
KIRK: You'll have to stand trial. But you did save the Enterprise from
the Romulans, and I will recommend that be taken into consideration. <br/>
ALIEN: Thank you, Captain. <br/>
(The Vendorian changes into Carter Winston) <br/>
KIRK: In the meantime, I'm afraid I'll have to keep you under guard. I

ANNE: Captain, could you assign me that duty. <br/>
CARTER: But you've seem me. You know what I am. <br/>

MCCOY: You caught him. <br/>
SPOCK: Acute observation, Doctor. <br/>
MCCOY: I'm glad to see him under guard, Jim. If he'd turned into a
second Spock, it would've been too much to take. <br/>
SPOCK: Perhaps. But then two Doctor McCoys just might bring the level
of medical efficiency on this ship up to acceptable levels. </font>
