HOSHI: And the bugs. <br/>
REED: Does the Captain have to give a speech? <br/>
T'POL: He's working on it now. <br/>
TRAVIS: He hates giving speeches. <br/>
REED: And he'll undoubtedly make every effort to take no credit. <br/>

people to be larger than life. <br/>
TROI: Has the Andorian hailed them? <br/>
RIKER: Not yet. <br/>
TROI: You might want to leap ahead to that point. It's where things
start really happening. And you should consider taking over the Galley.
<br/>
RIKER: Why? <br/>
TROI: Well, Starfleet ships didn't have counsellors in those days, but
the Chef on the first Enterprise came pretty close. I read almost
everybody confided in him. <br/>

what, three years? <br/>(Hoshi opens the channe.l) <br/>SHRAN: This is quite a surprise. <br/>
SHRAN: [on viewscreen]: I'm sorry, pinkskin, but it was essential
certain people believed I had met my demise. <br/>
ARCHER: Including me. <br/>
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: I know it's been a while, but as I recall, you
still owe me a favour. <br/>
ARCHER: I remember. But this isn't a good time, Shran. I assume you
know where we're heading. <br/>
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: I may no longer be a member of the Imperial
Guard, but I'm aware of the proposed coalition. <br/>
ARCHER: It's more than a proposal. We're on our way to Earth to sign
the charter. <br/>
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: The ceremony isn't for three days. If my plan
works, you'll be home in plenty of time. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm afraid a detour is out of the question right now. <br/>
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: My child's been abducted! Kidnapped. You owe me.
<br/>
ARCHER: You never told me you had a child. <br/>
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Jhamel gave birth five years ago. A daughter.
They've taken her. <br/>
ARCHER: Who? <br/>
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Former associates. It's a long story. You need
to let me come aboard. <br/>
ARCHER: Set a rendezvous course. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SHRAN: Who would've thought civilian life would be
more dangerous than commanding a ship for the Imperial Guard. <br/>
ARCHER: I still don't understand why you left. You were a hero. <br/>
SHRAN: A hero with a family. I always believed that change was a good
thing. I was a fool. <br/>
ARCHER: Why would you fake your own death? <br/>
SHRAN: I made some poor choices. Picked the wrong friends. People
involved in questionable
business ventures. They think I took something that belonged to them.
With the help of some old colleagues from the Guard, I managed to make
myself disappear. It worked for nearly three years. <br/>
ARCHER: Your friends found you? <br/>
SHRAN: Six months ago. I've been on the move ever since. They took her
in the middle of the night. I was in the next room, asleep. Useless!
It's been a week. They say if I don't return what's theirs, they'll
kill her. <br/>
ARCHER: Then give them what they want. <br/>
SHRAN: I don't have it! I never did. <br/>
ARCHER: But you have a plan. <br/>
SHRAN: It cost me everything I had, but I managed to find out where
they've taken her. They're on a trading outpost, Rigel Ten. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm familiar with it. <br/>
SHRAN: I know these men quite well, Captain. I can outwit them, I've
done it before. But I'll need at least seven men. You have to help me.
It's my little girl. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">T'POL: He's an admitted criminal. You said so
yourself. <br/>
ARCHER: He said he fell in with some disreputable people. That doesn't
make him a criminal. <br/>
T'POL: If we're late for the ceremony, it will have far-reaching
consequences. <br/>
ARCHER: If Shran hadn't helped us, I never would've gotten aboard the
Xindi weapon. Have you forgotten that? This alliance is based on
friendship and loyalty, exactly what Shran is looking for right now. <br/>
T'POL: I don't trust him. <br/>
ARCHER: You don't trust Andorians. You never have. Thank God the Vulcan
Council is a little more enlightened than you are. If they're willing
to forge an alliance with Andoria, the least you can do is give Shran
the benefit of the doubt. When we met ten years ago, I didn't trust
you. For that matter, I didn't trust any Vulcans. You helped me get
past that, remember? I listened to you, now it's your turn to listen to
me. I can't turn my back on him, T'Pol. Try to understand. <br/>
T'POL: I'll try. <br/>
ARCHER: By the way, drop by the galley when you get a moment. Chef's
trying to come up with a menu for our last dinner together. He wants to
know everybody's favourite dish. <br/>
T'POL: There are eighty three crewmembers aboard. <br/>
ARCHER: Just go see him, all right? <br/>
(She leaves, and Porthos jumps up to his master) <br/>
ARCHER: Don't worry. Chef's promised at least six kinds of cheese. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Galley]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">T'POL: I appreciate the gesture, but it's not
necessary to prepare a special dish for me. <br/>
RIKER: (as the chef) Come on. I've already started to reduce the
plomeek broth. All I need to know is which roots you prefer. <br/>
T'POL: In that case, I prefer to be surprised. <br/>
RIKER: Pull up a chair. I could use the company. I heard a rumour I may
be whipping up some Andorian cabbage soup tonight. <br/>
T'POL: We have already lost five hours picking up Shran's shuttle. Now
we're going to lose at least another day diverting our course to Rigel.
<br/>
RIKER: His child's in danger. <br/>
T'POL: Is there anything aboard this ship you don't know? <br/>
RIKER: Jonathan is a compassionate man. You should know that by now. <br/>
T'POL: His compassion has gotten us into trouble on many occasions. We
could miss this ceremony. <br/>
RIKER: Don't worry. I've got a hunch you're going to make it. Tea? <br/>
T'POL: Thank you. <br/>
RIKER: Phlox has giving me his largest Edosian suckerfish. <br/>
T'POL: Excuse me? <br/>
RIKER: Looks like a catfish. I'm hoping it tastes like one. Commander
Tucker's crazy for catfish.
Do you ever miss him? <br/>
T'POL: I spent the morning with him, recalibrating the plasma array. <br/>
RIKER: That's not what I mean. <br/>
T'POL: If you're referring to our intimate relationship, that's been
over for six years. <br/>
RIKER: But the question remains, do you miss him? <br/>
T'POL: I'm Vulcan. I don't miss people. <br/>
RIKER: Sorry, I forgot. Is he as concerned as you are about making this
ceremony? <br/>
T'POL: Trip rarely questions the Captain's decisions. <br/>
RIKER: He doesn't strike me as someone who follows orders blindly. <br/>
T'POL: He's not. He simply tends to agree with the Captain most of the
time. He trusts him. <br/>
RIKER: Would you peel these for me? <br/>(A bowl of large carrots.) <br/>
T'POL: Before I joined this crew, I never could have imagined anything
more important than following orders. <br/>
RIKER: And now? <br/>
T'POL: Humans believe that sometimes you have to follow your instincts.
A very illogical approach, but one I've come to embrace. <br/>

TROI: You're feeling guilty. You think in some way you were

RIKER: You're the empath. Why don't you tell me? <br/>

again. <br/>
RIKER: Why don't we change the subject? Okay? <br/>
TROI: Okay. How did things go on the Holodeck? <br/>
RIKER: They picked up the Andorian. They're on their way to Rigel Ten. <br/>

up to me. <br/>

time on the NX-01? <br/>

confident our replication will look authentic. <br/>

asteroid field.) <br/>
DATA [OC]: Data to Counsellor Troi. <br/>
TROI: Yes, Data. <br/>
DATA [OC]: I was wondering if this might be an appropriate time to
continue our discussion on the long-term effects of space travel on my
positronic net. <br/>
TROI: Can I give you a rain check? <br/>DATA [OC]: You may check me for rain if you like, Counsellor, but I assure you
there is no water in my <br/>(Doorbell chimes.) <br/>
TROI: Data, I'll get back to you. Come in. <br/>
RIKER: I know it's past office hours. <br/>
TROI: What is it? <br/>
RIKER: It won't be long before they find the Pegasus. <br/>
TROI: You haven't made your decision. The holodeck? <br/>
RIKER: They rescued the Andorian's daughter. <br/>
TROI: So you're coming to the moment of truth in there, as well. <br/>
RIKER: I need you to promise you'll keep this confidential. <br/>
TROI: You know I will. <br/>
RIKER: What do you know about the Treaty of Algeron? <br/>
TROI: 2311. It redefined the Romulan Neutral Zone. <br/>
RIKER: It also outlawed the use of cloaking technology on Starfleet
vessels. <br/>
TROI: The Pegasus? <br/>
RIKER: A secret group in Starfleet Security developed a prototype.
Pressman was put in charge of testing it. <br/>
TROI: That's why they're so eager to find it before the Romulans do. <br/>
RIKER: The accident, the seventy one people who died, we were testing
the cloaking device. <br/>
TROI: It was covered up. <br/>
RIKER: The nine of us who made it back alive were sworn to secrecy. <br/>
TROI: And you've lived with that for twelve years? <br/>
RIKER: They want to pick the experiment up where they left off. <br/>
TROI: Are you sure? <br/>
RIKER: Pressman told me himself. What they're doing is wrong. It could
jeopardise the treaty. <br/>
TROI: And you want to tell that to Captain Picard. <br/>
RIKER: I took an oath of secrecy. Pressman still outranks the Captain. <br/>
TROI: Will, you didn't get this far in your career making easy
decisions. I'm confident you'll make the right one now. <br/>

REED: He was anything but tactful. What his countrymen might refer to
as a hick.
For the life of me, I couldn't understand what Captain Archer saw in
him. <br/>
RIKER: Thinner. Roll it a little bit thinner, like this. <br/>
REED: Yeah, right. <br/>
RIKER: Go on. <br/>
REED: That's about it, really. I used to think that first impressions
meant something. I guess it's not always true. To be honest, I didn't
think he was going to last a month, old friend of the Captain's or not.
And now, I can't imagine what these last ten years would've been like
without him. <br/>
RIKER: Did you ever find yourself attracted to him? <br/>
HOSHI: Maybe a little. I never really thought he was my type. Didn't
even graduate college, he learned about engineering working on boat
engines, I think. Never cared much about languages, could barely speak
English. But he did have his moments. I still find him kind of cute.
Keep that to yourself. <br/>
RIKER: Always do. Captain said they'd known each other a long time. <br/>
TRAVIS: Close to twenty years. He taught the Captain how to scuba dive
somewhere off the coast of Florida. <br/>
RIKER: You're pressing too hard. Just slow, steady movement. <br/>
TRAVIS: Sorry. <br/>
RIKER: No need to apologise. <br/>
TRAVIS: They've got a shorthand they use sometimes. Comes from spending
so much time together. <br/>
RIKER: Did Trip ever take a swing at Picard? <br/>
TRAVIS: At who? <br/>
RIKER: Archer, Captain Archer? <br/>
TRAVIS: Not that I know of. When push comes to shove, Commander Tucker
usually ends up doing the right thing. How am I doing? <br/>
RIKER: Don't let it get too big. Now fold it over. There you go. <br/>
PHLOX: And he's always pushing himself, often to the point of
exhaustion. He's forced me to order him to relax on more than one
occasion. <br/>
RIKER: To relax? <br/>
PHLOX: Yeah. Wasn't very keen on getting neuro-pressure treatments from
T'Pol, but it was that or become addicted to sedatives. <br/>
RIKER: If I remember correctly, that's when <br/>
PHLOX: Their romance began? Precisely. One time, he became so exhausted
I had to demand he get six hours sleep. He negotiated it down to four.
A very stubborn young man. <br/>(Waving the pastry around.) <br/>PHLOX: I quite enjoy
this. <br/>
RIKER: So did he follow your orders? <br/>
PHLOX: Didn't have a choice. <br/>

TUCKER: So do you think this alliance is going to hold? <br/>
ARCHER: We'd better hope so. There are thousands of planets within
reach. Got to start somewhere. <br/>
TUCKER: Who would have guessed? Vulcans and Andorians in the same bed. <br/>
ARCHER: The Tellarites were never big fans of the Andorians, either.
This is a special bottle of whiskey. Zefram Cochrane gave it to my
father the day they broke ground at the warp five complex. <br/>
TUCKER: And here we are, toasting to warp seven. <br/>
ARCHER: Here's to the next generation. <br/>
TUCKER: Written your speech yet? <br/>
ARCHER: I always crammed before exams. I've got three days left. <br/>
TUCKER: The biggest day of your life, and you're going to wait until
the night before. <br/>
ARCHER: It's the biggest day of our lives. <br/>
TUCKER: I hate to contradict you, Captain. You're the man they're
waiting to see. <br/>

protocols. Is that okay? <br/>
ALIEN: As long as you keep your hands where we can see them. <br/>
TUCKER: No problem. <br/>(Tucker takes a large panel from the wall, reaches in and
removes a large tube.) <br/>TUCKER: Now, all I need to do is connect this to the
relay inside that panel. <br/>

T'POL: My mother was somewhat eccentric, as well. <br/>
ARCHER: I remember. <br/>
T'POL: Trip told me as the years went by that I would miss her less.
But he was wrong, because I find myself missing her more. Why would he
tell me that? <br/>
ARCHER: Time heals all wounds, but absence makes the heart grow fonder.
I guess it's a little tricky. Emotions have a way of contradicting
themselves. <br/>
T'POL: And you wonder why we suppress them. <br/>
ARCHER: When I took command ten years ago, I saw myself as an explorer.
I thought all the risks
would be worth it because, just beyond the next planet, just beyond the
next star, there would be something magnificent, something noble. And
now Trip is dead, and I have to give a speech about how worthwhile it's
all been. <br/>

someone's not going to hurt you, no matter what. Where you know they'll
always be there for you, no matter how bad things get. You ever know
