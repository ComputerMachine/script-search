FORREST: Well done, Jonathan. <br/>
ARCHER: Thank you, Admiral. <br/>
(the applause dies down, and Archer steps to the rostrum) <br/>
ARCHER: I've been told that people are calling us heroes. When it comes
to my crew, you won't get any argument from me.
But I think it's important that we remember the heroes who aren't with
us. the twenty seven crewmen who didn't make it back. Without their
sacrifice, I wouldn't be standing here right now. None of us would. But
I'm sure I speak on behalf of my entire crew when I say it's good to be
home.

to sit at a table. <br/>
ARCHER: I heard about your promotion. Congratulations, Captain. <br/>
ERIKA: Thank you. <br/>
ARCHER: Cheers. <br/>
ERIKA: Cheers. So what was it like in the Expanse? <br/>
ARCHER: You'll be at the debriefing tomorrow, won't you? I wouldn't
want to spoil any surprises. Besides, I've got more important
questions. Seen any good movies while I was gone? <br/>
ERIKA: Another World War III epic. It swept all the awards. But you
haven't missed much. Earth's been holding its breath for the past year,
wondering if the Xindi were going to come back and finish the job. On
the bright side, there've been more weddings and births than ever
before. <br/>

T'POL: Come in. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, it looks like you're taking enough clothes to last a
year. <br/>
T'POL: You wanted something? <br/>
TUCKER: I told the Captain I wanted to stay aboard and supervise the
refit, but he suggested I take a break. More like an order, actually.
Problem is, I'm not sure where to go. Lizzie's gone, my home town
doesn't exist anymore. Guess this is my home now. <br/>
T'POL: You could come with me. <br/>
TUCKER: To Vulcan? <br/>
T'POL: The transport leaves at eleven hundred hours. <br/>
TUCKER: Where would I stay? <br/>
T'POL: There's a guest room in my mother's home. <br/>
TUCKER: Oh, your mom's house, huh? What does she know about me? About
us? <br/>
T'POL: I've never mentioned you. <br/>
TUCKER: So you'd introduce me as? <br/>
T'POL: Commander Charles Tucker the third. You've told the Captain that
you don't get to see as many alien cultures as you'd like. You've never
been to Vulcan. <br/>
TUCKER: Eleven hundred hours, huh? I'd better start packing.

ERIKA: We've tied these stations directly in the primary EPS junction. <br/>
ARCHER: I hope you don't mind if I steal some of these improvements. <br/>
ERIKA: I won't say anything if you do me a small favour. My senior
officer candidates. I'd like to get your opinion. You've served with a few of them. <br/>
(She hands over a data chip. Archer refers to the Captain's chair.) <br/>
ARCHER: You might want to talk to
someone about installing a lumbar support. You're going to spend a lot
of hours in that chair. <br/>
ERIKA: We've improved hull polarisation by twelve percent. We'll be
able to hang in a firefight a little longer. <br/>
ARCHER: Ventral and dorsal torpedo launchers, pulsed phase cannons. <br/>
ERIKA: Upgrades you recommended. What is it? <br/>
ARCHER: I had an argument once with Captain Jefferies. He was one of
the designers of the NX-Class. <br/>
ERIKA: I'm aware of that. <br/>
ARCHER: I told him I didn't want to be in command of a warship trying
to make first contact with new species. Jefferies was right. We needed
those weapons, and a hell of a lot more. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The debriefing session.) <br/>
ARCHER: The asteroids were loaded with trellium ore. We think the
Vulcans entered the field in order to mine it. <br/>
WILLIAMS: Trellium? <br/>
ARCHER: It's an alloy that protects against spatial anomalies. Ships in
the Expanse used it to insulate their hulls. <br/>
WILLIAMS: Your log reflects that when you boarded the Seleya you found
the crew in a delusional, violent state. <br/>
ARCHER: They attacked us the minute we docked. The trellium had a toxic
effect on the Vulcans. It damaged their neural pathways. They lost the
ability to suppress their emotions. <br/>
SOVAL: According to your log, the entire crew of the Seleya was killed
when you triggered a reactor breach. <br/>
ARCHER: The breach was an accident. We were trying to disable their
power grid. <br/>
SOVAL: As far as I can determine, you didn't try to save a single
Vulcan crewman. <br/>
ARCHER: There was no point. They were too far gone. <br/>
SOVAL: Is that your medical opinion, Captain? <br/>
ARCHER: Phlox made that determination. <br/>
SOVAL: Our specialists have examined the data you sent back. It's far
from certain that the neurological damage was irreversible. <br/>
ARCHER: There was nothing we could do for them. <br/>
SOVAL: T'Pol was exposed to the trellium. She recovered. <br/>
ARCHER: I couldn't help them! <br/>
SOVAL: There's no need to get emotional, Captain. You spent several
hours in the ship's auxiliary control room. In that time, did you try
to access the internal sensors, or download the computer database? <br/>
ARCHER: No. <br/>
SOVAL: So in effect, we don't know what really happened aboard the
Seleya. <br/>
ARCHER: What the hell does that mean? <br/>
SOVAL: Because of this oversight, we'll never have a complete picture
of the events that led to the ship's destruction. <br/>
ARCHER: I just told you exactly what led to the ship's destruction. <br/>
FORREST: Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm not going to sit here and be accused of murdering those
people. <br/>
SOVAL: No one is accusing you of anything, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe that crew would still be alive if you'd been a little
more helpful. <br/>
SOVAL: I beg your pardon? <br/>
ARCHER: You did everything you could to sabotage our mission. I got
more help from the Andorians than I ever got from the High Command. <br/>
FORREST: That's enough, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: This planet would be a cloud of dust right now if we'd listened
to you. <br/>

REED: Not exactly travelling light, are you? <br/>
PHLOX: Thank you. Why leave the comforts of home, when you can take it
all with you? <br/>
REED: Okay. I trust you'll be taking the proper precautions on the
surface. <br/>
PHLOX: What do you mean? <br/>
REED: I'm surprised you haven't heard. An Andorian and two Rigelians
were attacked. <br/>
PHLOX: Attacked? Why? <br/>
REED: Apparently the Xindi incident has caused a degree of xenophobia.
It's hard to believe in this day and age. I'm told the Vulcans are
staying behind the walls of their compound. <br/>
PHLOX: Well, I'm not going to let a few isolated incidents disrupt my
vacation plans. I lived on Earth for many years before coming aboard
Enterprise. <br/>
REED: I don't think this is the same planet you remember, Doctor.
People are looking for someone to blame and they don't care who it is. <br/>

Starfleet transmit it to your ship? <br/>
T'POL: We had communication difficulties in the Expanse. <br/>
T'LES: I don't know why you're surprised. This was planned years ago.
There's more to life than one's profession. Perhaps you'll learn that

You received this yesterday. <br/>

that many schools named after him. <br/>

all too eager to finish her schooling and leave Vulcan. <br/>

T'LES: A mother is expected to push her young out of the nest. At some
point, they're supposed to return. I'm told that on Earth a human child

criminal. How could you let them do this? <br/>
T'LES: You've changed. Your emotions were always close to the surface,
but you managed to suppress them. It's because of this Commander
Tucker, isn't it? He's the reason why you refuse to bond with Koss. Do
you really believe that a human and a Vulcan can have a future
together? Imagine the shame your children would endure, assuming that
the two of you could have children. <br/>
T'POL: That wouldn't be your concern.

can't sleep. The nocturnal noises prompt him to get a phase pistol from
his rucksack and go scouting. He is jumped by a pair of Xindi
reptilians who throw him off a cliff,
and he wakes up screaming.) <br/>
ERIKA: You all right? <br/>
ARCHER: I'm not even sure what all right means anymore. <br/>
ERIKA: Want to talk about it? There's an old code among climbers.
Anything that happens on the mountain stays there. <br/>
ARCHER: You want to know why I'm out here? I figured this is the last
place I'd run into anyone who'd want to shake my hand or take my
picture or tell me I'm an inspiration to their children. If they knew
what I'd done. <br/>
ERIKA: You did what any captain would have done. <br/>
ARCHER: Does that include torture? Or marooning a ship full of innocent
people? Because I don't remember reading those chapters in the
handbook. <br/>
ERIKA: Where are you going, Jon? Are you going to go climbing in the
middle of the night? <br/>
ARCHER: Why not? <br/>
ERIKA: It'd be a shame if you lost your footing. It's a long way down.
But at least you wouldn't have to deal with these feelings anymore. <br/>
ARCHER: Are you telling me I have some kind of a death wish? <br/>
ERIKA: You tell me. <br/>
All I'm trying to do is get away from you. I look at you, and I see the
person I was three years ago. The explorer that my father wanted me to
be. I lost something out there, and I don't know how to get it back. <br/>
(Erika leans over and kisses him, long and gentle.) <br/>
ARCHER: What was that? <br/>
ERIKA: Something I haven't done in a while. Whatever you lost, maybe I
could help you find it. </font></p>

TUCKER: You know, if we have time when we get back to Earth, I'd like
to show you some sights, return the favour. Everything okay? <br/>
T'POL: There's something I need to tell you. I've decided to marry
Koss. <br/>
TUCKER: Marry him? <br/>
T'POL: If I join his family, my mother will regain her position at the
Academy. His father is a senior Minister with a great deal of
influence. <br/>
TUCKER: I don't get it. Are they forcing you to do this? <br/>
T'POL: The decision was mine. My mother resigned because of my actions.
<br/>
TUCKER: You told me three years ago you didn't even love this guy. So
you're just going to leave Starfleet, move back to Vulcan? <br/>
T'POL: I've been negotiating with Koss's family. <br/>
TUCKER: Negotiating? <br/>
T'POL: They've agreed we won't have to reside together, not right away.
I'll remain on Enterprise for the time being. <br/>
TUCKER: That's real generous of them. <br/>
T'POL: Trip, I have to do this for many reasons. <br/>
TUCKER: And how am I supposed to take this? <br/>
T'POL: I'm sorry. <br/>
TUCKER: You're sorry. You brought me sixteen light years just to watch
you get married to someone you barely know. </font></p>

ARCHER: You remember that planet I told you about? There was a mountain
range on the southern continent. The view was almost as amazing as
this. <br/>
ERIKA: That's a good day's climb we've got ahead of us. We can reach
the summit by nightfall, but we should get moving. <br/>
ARCHER: I think the view is fine from here. I'm glad you tagged along. <br/>
ERIKA: You know, there's still something I'm not quite clear about. <br/>
ARCHER: What's that? <br/>
ERIKA: Why did we stop seeing each other? <br/>
ARCHER: Well, I was your superior officer. It wasn't appropriate. <br/>
ERIKA: You're not my superior anymore. (they kiss) I wonder if
Starfleet would approve? The captains of the only two warp five ships? <br/>

PHLOX: Hmm? <br/>
HOSHI: Madame Chang's. Don't tell me that you forgot. <br/>
PHLOX: My osmotic eel is under the weather. I should stay aboard until
she's feeling better. <br/>
HOSHI: Wait. No, you've been talking about the egg-drop soup at this
place for as long as I've known you. <br/>
PHLOX: I'm sure you and Ensign Mayweather will enjoy it. <br/>
HOSHI: I spoke with Travis. What happened to you the other night? <br/>
PHLOX: Oh, you must mean the, er ((holding breath gesture). Nothing
more than an instinctive defensive response. <br/>
HOSHI: So you're going to stay aboard the ship because of some
loudmouth in a bar? <br/>
PHLOX: My presence could provoke another incident. Someone could get
hurt. <br/>
HOSHI: This isn't the way to deal with prejudice. The best thing is to
show your face and remind people that there are aliens who don't want
to blow up the planet. <br/>
PHLOX: I can't blame those men for the way they reacted. Earth has
survived a horrific attack. It will take time for the trauma to heal.
Besides, I have friends to keep me company. Now, if it's not too much
trouble? <br/>

ARCHER: I'm glad we can finally agree on something. <br/>
SOVAL: Captain. Your actions, while being morally questionable, were
necessary. I opposed your appointment as captain of Enterprise, but
it's obvious now that I was wrong. T'Pol has told me that the Expanse
would have someday encompassed hundreds of systems, including Vulcan.
You've done a great service for both our worlds. <br/>(He holds out his hand.)

once before we were joined. In time, we developed a deep connection to
each other. <br/>

else. <br/>

T'LES: I may not condone your relationship, but it's important for her
to have all the facts. <br/>

not call it off. She's got enough pressure on her as it is. I don't
