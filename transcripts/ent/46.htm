TRAVIS: Mayweather. <br/>
HOSHI [OC] The captain wants you to report to the Bridge. Admiral
Forrest called a few minutes ago. We're reversing course. <br/>

The planet's orbit has shifted, taking it between two gas giants. Their
gravitational pull is causing its core to superheat. <br/>
ARCHER: Starfleet thinks it will be covered with erupting volcanoes by
the end of the week. <br/>
TRAVIS: This system's almost thirty light years behind us. <br/>
ARCHER: Admiral Forrest assures me it's only a temporary detour. <br/>
TUCKER: Some geologic fireworks. Could be fun. <br/>

Come in. <br/>
TRAVIS: Do you have a minute, sir? <br/>
ARCHER: Several, actually. Please. What's on your mind? <br/>
TRAVIS: I was wondering if I could make a personal request. <br/>
ARCHER: Of course. <br/>
TRAVIS: My family's ship, the Horizon, we're going to be passing close
to it. I wouldn't mind going by for a visit. It's about ten hours off
our flight path. Enterprise can still get to the planet with time to
spare. You could pick me up on the way back. <br/>
ARCHER: I think we can manage without you for a few days. <br/>
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: Your folks'll be surprised to see you. <br/>
TRAVIS: My father's been ill for a few months. <br/>
ARCHER: Nothing serious, I hope. <br/>
TRAVIS: My mother said he'll be fine. She's the ship's medic. <br/>
ARCHER: I thought you told me your mother was the chief engineer. <br/>
(Both sit.) <br/>
TRAVIS: She's both. <br/>
ARCHER: I guess they have to wear a lot of hats to keep those old ships
running. <br/>
TRAVIS: My grandfather held the record. Five jobs at one time, two of
them on the bridge. <br/>
ARCHER: There was a time when I gave serious thought to serving on a
cargo ship. <br/>
TRAVIS: You, sir? <br/>
ARCHER: It was a few years before Starfleet was chartered. <br/>
TRAVIS: Why didn't you sign up? <br/>
ARCHER: Long story. I'll tell you the next time we have breakfast.
After we dock, I'll have Phlox go over with you, have him take a look
at your father. <br/>

You'll be glad to hear the thermal scanners are up and running. <br/>
T'POL: And the imaging relays? <br/>
TUCKER: Yep. We'll drop six of them in high orbit. That should give us
a bird's-eye view of every volcano on the planet. You know, there's not
going to be a lot to do once we get there. Sensors will record
everything automatically. <br/>
T'POL: You should have plenty of time to practice your harmonica. <br/>
TUCKER: I've talked Chef into doing something special. Starting
Tuesday, it's going to be movie night every night. Thought you might be
interested, seeing how you enjoyed that western. We're going to be
showing the three greatest horror movies ever made. Frankenstein, Bride
of Frankenstein and Son of Frankenstein. We might even throw in Abbott
and Costello Meet Frankenstein. <br/>
T'POL: I have no interest in horror movies. <br/>
TUCKER: How do you know if you've never seen one? You don't have to see
all of them. Just come the first night. I promise you'll like it.

Four years isn't so long. My last family reunion was almost a decade
ago. <br/>
TRAVIS: Starfleet really ought to think about putting families on
starships. <br/>
REED: You must be joking. <br/>
TRAVIS: No one would ever get homesick. <br/>
REED: Yes. Well, they'd better post a psychologist onboard because I'd
need one if my parents were roaming the corridors. <br/>
TRAVIS: On a cargo ship, you can't walk ten metres without running into
your baby-sitter or a great-aunt. <br/>
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Ensign Mayweather. <br/>

Mind if I join you? <br/>
TRAVIS: Of course not. <br/>
ARCHER: I haven't been up here since we launched. Come here a lot? <br/>
TRAVIS: Every now and then. <br/>
ARCHER: Commander Tucker told me what happened. I'm sorry. <br/>
TRAVIS: My mother sent a message to Starfleet six weeks ago, but I
never got it. <br/>
ARCHER: The civilian channels can be pretty slow. <br/>
TRAVIS: I should have called him. We were in comm. range a few months
ago. I guess I wasn't ready to talk to him yet. He wasn't very happy
with me when I joined Starfleet. He'd been grooming me for his job
since I was kid. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sure it wasn't easy for him when you left, but I know for a
fact that he was proud of you. <br/>
TRAVIS: With all respect, sir, I'm not so sure he was. <br/>
ARCHER: Did he ever tell you about the letter he sent me? It was almost
two and a half years ago. There were a few candidates I was looking at
for helm officer. I was having a little trouble deciding, so I
contacted their former COs hoping for a more personal evaluation. <br/>
TRAVIS: What did he say? <br/>
ARCHER: He wrote the shortest recommendation. Just one sentence. He
said he'd never met a more natural stick and rudder man in his life and
I'd be a fool if I didn't choose you. When I saw how you handled
yourself at the helm, I knew he was right. <br/>

If you're looking for a medical excuse, I'm afraid you're out of luck.
If it's any consolation, I'll be there as well. I agree this form of
entertainment is rather crude, but it can often provide an enlightening
glimpse into human behaviour. <br/>

(Enterprise has rendezvoused with the Horizon.) <br/>
TUCKER: Just a quick tour of the engine room. That's all I'm asking. <br/>
TRAVIS: The Horizon's fifty years old. I'm sure you've seen far more
impressive warp reactors. <br/>
TUCKER: Zephram Cochrane designed that engine himself. I've heard
rumours that he personally signed the inside of each reactor casing.
Oh, almost forgot. <br/>
(They reach the airlock, and Trip hands over a PADD.) <br/>
TRAVIS: What's this? <br/>
TUCKER: A few family photos. I downloaded every picture I've taken
since we left Spacedock. Thought your mom might like to see what her
boy's been up to. <br/>

I wouldn't call it a dangerous mission. We've gotten into a few
skirmishes, but nothing we couldn't handle. <br/>
RIANNA: I got a letter from your sister. She said you mentioned a close
call with some kind of storm. <br/>
TRAVIS: We ran into a small wavefront a few months ago. The crew had to
squeeze into one of the nacelles for a couple of days. She probably
made it sound worse than it was. <br/>
RIANNA: She also mentioned something about alien soldiers forcing their
way aboard. <br/>
TRAVIS: It was really just a misunderstanding. They thought Enterprise
had been abandoned. Captain Archer convinced them to leave. <br/>
RIANNA: I guess there's no point in asking you about the Romulan
minefield. <br/>
TRAVIS: How'd you know about that? <br/>
RIANNA: I've been serving on cargo ships for a long time. I've made a
few contacts here and there. <br/>
VOICE [OC]: Stand by to go to warp. <br/>
(They brace them selves for the jolt and judders.) <br/>
TRAVIS: Charlie must be at the helm. <br/>
RIANNA: What makes you say that? <br/>
TRAVIS: His warp jumps were always a little rough. Where are we headed?
<br/>
RIANNA: Deneva station. Just a quick run to pick up supplies. We'll
have you back in plenty of time. <br/>
MAN: (doing some welding) Watch your step, ma'am. Travis? <br/>
TRAVIS: Hey! <br/>

container again? <br/>

don't get VIPs very often. I found some of your old things. Thought you
might feel more at home. <br/>

Dad kept a lot of the inventory in his head. I'm trying to reconstruct
the database. We still can't find the stromatopod larvae we're supposed
to be delivering to the Demerians. I only hope they didn't end up in

Cargo Authority wasn't too pleased. We're also low on deuterium. We've
had to dip into the reserves twice this month. Morale's been better,

high-yield explosive. If anyone gets too close, it might decide to go
off. <br/>
(Senior staff gather at the back of the small Bridge to see a display
on a monitor.) <br/>
JUAN: The Constellation sent us this. This ship attacked them eight
weeks ago and it planted a beacon on their hull. A day later, this
cruiser showed up and demanded their cargo. The Constellation tried to
drive them off, but the aliens got aboard and killed three of their
crew. Then they took the entire shipment. <br/>

two? <br/>

different from a Mazarite ship. <br/>

TRAVIS: We had some trouble with them. We managed to knock out their
engines with our phase cannons. <br/>
PAUL: We don't have phase cannons. <br/>
TRAVIS: I can tie the plasma turrets directly into the impulse engines.
Lieutenant Reed did that and it increased our yield by eighty percent. <br/>
PAUL: I'm not going to risk all of our lives by getting into a fight we
can't win. If they reach us before we make it to Deneva, we'll give
them what they want. <br/>
TRAVIS: If there's one thing I've learned from Captain Archer, it's
that you don't give in to people like this. You're only going to
encourage more attacks, not just against you, but other cargo ships. <br/>
PAUL: I appreciate the advice, but this isn't your problem. You're not
part of this crew anymore. Jettison that ore and increase our speed. <br/>
RIANNA: (to Travis) Even your father had to make compromises. The
safest thing to do is give them what they want. Cargo can be replaced. </font></p>

DOCTOR F [on screen]: Just a few stitches. And look, here's the final
touch. A brain you stole, Fritz. Think of it, the brain of a dead man. <br/>
PHLOX: This Doctor Frankenstein, his technique is not dissimilar to a
practice on B'Saari Two. They successfully used an isolytic current to
reanimate the bodies of the recently deceased. <br/>

PHLOX: Of course, the revived individuals weren't capable of more than
basic cellular metabolism. However, the B'Saari have developed a

PAUL: You turned your back on us a long time ago. <br/>
TRAVIS: Is that what this is about? Me leaving? If you want to be an
effective captain, you've got to set your personal feelings aside,
listen to what other people have to say. <br/>
PAUL: More words of wisdom from Starfleet? <br/>
TRAVIS: No, your father. He said that to me a long time ago. If he was
here now, he'd tell you the same thing. <br/>
PAUL: You quoting Dad? You never listened to him. If you had, you
wouldn't have abandoned your family. You barely spoke to him for the
last four years. You weren't even here when he died. <br/>
TRAVIS: That isn't fair. <br/>
PAUL: You knew he was sick, but you didn't really care. You only
decided to stop by because it was convenient for you. Hostile aliens
aren't our problem, it's Starfleet and people like you. Do you have any
idea how hard it is to find new crewmen? No one wants to run freight
anymore. They all want to be explorers cruising around on state of the
art ships with their personal chefs. <br/>

I understand you made a few modifications to the impulse relays. Next

RIANNA: I've played referee between you and your brother for a long

TRAVIS: (picking at his food) Never thought I'd actually miss these. <br/>
RIANNA: Nutri-paks? <br/>
TRAVIS: Not just any Nutri-pak, strawberry shortcake. The first time I
tasted real shortcake was in San Francisco. It just wasn't the same. <br/>
RIANNA: I think they've ruined your taste buds. <br/>
TRAVIS: I wouldn't mind eating like this again. I'm thinking about
asking for an extended leave. I'm sure Captain Archer would approve,
considering. <br/>
RIANNA: How long would you stay? <br/>
TRAVIS: As long as I'm needed. <br/>
RIANNA: But you're needed on your ship. <br/>
TRAVIS: I'm not the only helm officer. <br/>
RIANNA: Even if your captain agrees, it could be a long time before
Enterprise is back this way again. <br/>
TRAVIS: There's a lot for me to do here. I can help upgrade the
guidance and warp systems. With a little luck, we could make Horizon
the fastest J-class in the fleet. <br/>
RIANNA: You're going to give up your career, move back home and take
orders from your brother? <br/>
TRAVIS: My career's the last thing on my mind right now. <br/>
RIANNA: Congratulations. Now you know what it's like to be a parent. I
could spend every waking minute worrying about you two, but I'd never
get any work done. <br/>
TRAVIS: He's not ready, Mum. <br/>
RIANNA: You should've seen your father when he took over. He was a year
younger than Paul is now. He was an engineer. He didn't know the first
thing about running a Bridge. We fell so far behind schedule, he almost
lost his ECA license. He wanted to quit. I wouldn't let him. Your
brother just needs some time. <br/>
TRAVIS: You don't think I should stay. <br/>
RIANNA: Didn't we have this conversation? It was right here in this
room, four years ago, when you first thought about joining Starfleet. <br/>
TRAVIS: A lot has changed in four years, Mum. <br/>
RIANNA: That's true, and a lot more's going to change. Will we be
talking about this again in another four years? You're the helmsman of
the first warp five starship. I'm proud of you. Everyone here is. Even
Paul, though he won't admit it. If you'll indulge a little motherly
advice, don't let your guilt over leaving guide your decision. <br/>
TRAVIS: I'll try to keep that in mind. Good night. <br/>

I find it hard to believe that no one on Vulcan's ever heard of a
horror movie. <br/>
T'POL: There is something similar. a discipline known as tarul-etek. It
uses disturbing imagery to provoke an emotional response. <br/>
ARCHER: They try and scare you to see how well you suppress your
emotions. <br/>
T'POL: I don't understand why humans would feel compelled to frighten
themselves. <br/>
ARCHER: Gets the heart pumping. <br/>
T'POL: Cardiovascular activity would be more efficient. <br/>
ARCHER: You never did give us your opinion of the movie. <br/>
T'POL: There were many medical inaccuracies. <br/>
TUCKER: What did you think of the story? <br/>
T'POL: I thought the protagonist was interesting. <br/>
TUCKER: Doctor Frankenstein. <br/>
T'POL: No, his creation. From my perspective, this was the story of an
individual persecuted by humans because he was different. <br/>
TUCKER: That's one way of looking at it. <br/>
T'POL: In many ways, the film seemed quite prophetic. The reaction of
the villagers, for example. It was similar to the reception Vulcans
received after landing on Earth. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't recall anyone greeting a Vulcan ambassador with torches
and pitchforks. <br/>
T'POL: Nevertheless, many humans reacted with fear and anger. <br/>
ARCHER: They didn't know what to expect. <br/>
T'POL: I'm going to recommend that Ambassador Soval watch the film. <br/>
TUCKER: You're kidding. <br/>
T'POL: I believe it would help Vulcans who've recently arrived on
Earth. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe inviting her to movie night wasn't such a great idea. <br/>
T'POL: On the contrary. I'm looking forward to Bride of Frankenstein. <br/>
