<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Degra wakes up on the floor of a small vessel.
He's dishevelled, his hair is long, and they are being attacked.) <br/>
DEGRA: who are you? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Archer is at the controls, also dishevelled with long hair.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
ARCHER: They're
targeting our engines. <br/>
DEGRA: What do you want with me? <br/>
ARCHER: You're the weapons expert. See if you can get those shields
back online. If we don't raise the shields, the only that's going to be
left of this ship is a cloud of vapour. <br/>(He pushes Degra aside and does it
himself. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Degra looks out of the porthole.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">)<br/>
DEGRA: Insectoids! <br/>
ARCHER: These could be shield emitters. They're not going to last for
long. <br/>
DEGRA: Open a channel to those ships. <br/>
ARCHER: What? <br/>
DEGRA: They're Xindi. I'll order them to hold their fire. <br/>
ARCHER: It's been a long time since any Xindi took orders from you.
We're carrying five hundred litres of warp plasma in the starboard
tanks. We'll have to vent it. Turn these down on my mark. They're going
to destroy us. Now! <br/>
DEGRA: What happened? <br/>
ARCHER: The plasma got into their intake manifolds. Their engines are
overheating. <br/>
DEGRA: I want to know who you are. Why you've abducted me. <br/>
ARCHER: You really don't remember. I was afraid this might happen. It's
me, Archer. <br/>
DEGRA: What species are you? <br/>
ARCHER: You've been through a lot in the last two days. Just let me
figure out <br/>
DEGRA: What species! <br/>
ARCHER: I'm human. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Degra backs away as far as he can.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
DEGRA: You're from the Earth vessel. <br/>
ARCHER: Degra, you have to listen to me. I'm not your enemy anymore.
You've spent the last two days in an interrogation chamber. Whatever
the insectoids did to you in there must have affected your memory. My
name is Jonathan Archer. The two of us just escaped from an insectoid
prison colony. <br/>
DEGRA: Prison? <br/>
ARCHER: We've shared a cell for almost three years. <br/>
DEGRA: That's not possible. <br/>
ARCHER: Roll up your sleeves. <br/>(They have similar tattoos on their
forearms.) <br/>ARCHER: The conflict between our people is over. We both lost. I
promise I'll explain everything. Right now we have to get out of here
before our friends out there repair their engines. <br/>
DEGRA: What are you doing? <br/>
ARCHER: There's a system about a week from here. It's isolated. I doubt
they'll look for us there. <br/>(As the shuttle rattles to warp, Degra
stares in disbelief at his reflection in a porthole.) <br/>
DEGRA: You expect me to believe my own people would hold me prisoner?
You think that's amusing? <br/>
ARCHER: It's been a while since you referred to those overgrown
grasshoppers as your own people. <br/>
DEGRA: Why don't I remember you? <br/>
ARCHER: Probably because of the bloodworms. <br/>
DEGRA: Bloodworms? <br/>
ARCHER: They're used during interrogations. Their secretions act as a
truth serum, makes the prisoners more co-operative. But there's a side
effect. Sometimes they can suppress memories. The same thing happened
when they questioned me. I forgot everything that happened since flight
school. It'll start to come back to you. Give it a few days.<br/>
DEGRA: You claim that I've been a prisoner for three years. <br/>
ARCHER: Three years. <br/>
DEGRA: If that's true, why would they question me now? <br/>
ARCHER: They wanted information about the weapon. <br/>
DEGRA: What kind of information? <br/>
ARCHER: This is going to take some time. What's the last thing you
remember? <br/>
DEGRA: I was on my vessel, approaching the planet in the Calindra
system. <br/>
ARCHER: The weapons test. It failed because your prototype was
sabotaged. <br/>
DEGRA: How would you know that? <br/>
ARCHER: Because I'm responsible for it. Your kemocite shipment was
tampered with. <br/>
DEGRA: Gralik. <br/>
ARCHER: He wasn't too happy when I told him what you were planning to
do with his kemocite. <br/>
DEGRA: He'll be executed for this. <br/>
ARCHER: He was. In the end it didn't make much of a difference. We
didn't stop your programme, we only slowed it down. A few weeks later
the weapon was launched. It destroyed my planet. <br/>
DEGRA: We were successful? <br/>
ARCHER: I don't know if you'd call it a success. After Earth was
destroyed the old Xindi rivalries surfaced again. The insectoids
started attacking other Xindi colonies. They killed thousands of your
people. <br/>
DEGRA: The reptilians and aquatics would never allow that. <br/>
ARCHER: There wasn't a lot they could do. While you were busy
constructing the weapon, the insectoids were secretly building hundreds
of new ships. They used Earth as a diversion. Their real goal was to
dominate the other Xindi species. Are you all right? <br/>(Something moves
under the skin of Degra's forearm.) <br/>ARCHER: It's just a bloodworm. It'll work
its was out. <br/>
DEGRA: Can you remove it?<br/>
(Archer rummages in a couple of lockers and finds a knife and a glass
vial.) <br/>
ARCHER: Hold still. <br/>(Archer cuts into Degra's arm, pulls out the six inch
long worm and puts it in the vial. Putting things away again
afterwards, he finds a bottle of something.) <br/>ARCHER: I think you need this more
than I do. Suit yourself. <br/>(He takes a swig.) <br/>
DEGRA: I don't understand how a Xindi and a human could put aside their
differences so quickly. <br/>
ARCHER: Trust me, it didn't happen overnight. <br/>(He points at to scar on his
forehead.) <br/>ARCHER: You gave me this the first day we were locked up together.
The guards thought it would be entertaining to put us in the same cell.
They even placed wagers on who would survive the longest. I was in
pretty bad shape at the time so you were the odds-on favourite. Your
people killed everyone I ever cared about. I was going to make sure you
never walked out of that cell. For weeks we tried to kill each other. I
was lying in the infirmary when I finally asked myself, what was the
point. My world was gone, but so was yours. So I made a proposal. The
two of us would work together to get out of that place. Took us longer
than either one of us thought, but here we are. <br/>
DEGRA: I don't recognise this type of ship. <br/>
ARCHER: It's a Malosian cargo shuttle. <br/>
DEGRA: Malosian. <br/>
ARCHER: They're traders. They bring supplies to the prison a few times
a month. No weapons, but she's sturdy enough to get us where we're
going. <br/>
DEGRA: Perhaps we should set a course to your vessel. Is it still in
the Expanse? <br/>
ARCHER: Not exactly. When we were getting close to finding your weapon
the insectoids sent their ships after us. They boarded Enterprise and
took me prisoner, then they planted spatial charges around our warp
reactor. My crew was still aboard when they detonated them. <br/>
DEGRA: The insectoids were always the aggressive species, but I never
thought them capable of this. They destroyed everything the Council
worked for. <br/>
ARCHER: The Council? <br/>
DEGRA: It was formed when our planet was destroyed. It was created to
find a new home world for all Xindi. After years of searching we found
a few suitable locations, but as usual couldn't agree on a final
choice. Our plan for reunification was put aside when we learned of the
threat from Earth. I was ordered to begin designing the weapon. I
devoted years to it. I made so many sacrifices. So did my wife. Do I
know what happened to my family? <br/>
ARCHER: You told me you'd heard from Naara before you were sent to
prison. She and the children were safe. We have a ship now. We can look
for them. <br/>
DEGRA: They were on a colony near a red giant. <br/>
ARCHER: There's nothing in range. Do you remember the coordinates? <br/>
DEGRA: I doubt if there's anything left. It would have been one of the
first colonies to be attacked. <br/>
ARCHER: There may have been survivors. <br/>
DEGRA: It's too dangerous. Patrol ships are still looking for us. We
should find a refuge in case. <br/>
(There's a hiss, and green gas starts coming into the cabin.) <br/>
ARCHER: Reactor coolant. The conduit must have ruptured in the attack.
Take it. <br/>(The only oxygen mask.)<br/>
DEGRA: What about you? <br/>
ARCHER: You're the one with a family. You want to see them again? Try
to seal the rupture. I'll see if I can close off the coolant tanks.
<br/>(Archer collapses as Degra seals the gash with a mini welder. Once he's done
it, he shares the oxygen with Archer as the air clears. Later, as Degra sleeps, Archer gets a hypospray from its hiding place
and injects him.) </font></p>

T'POL: There are seven red giants in this region, but they're spread
over approximately forty light years. <br/>
ARCHER: Can we scan them for a weapons facility? <br/>
T'POL: Not at this distance. <br/>
TUCKER: This red giant might be a red herring. He only told you his
family was living near one of these stars. We don't know that the
weapon is there. <br/>
ARCHER: Degra's a senior official. We know he's designing the weapon.
There's a chance he'd keep his family close by. <br/>
HOSHI: For a moment, I thought he was going to give you the
co-ordinates. <br/>
TUCKER: Too bad he didn't go for the Andorian ale. That would've
loosened him up. <br/>
T'POL: You appear to have gained his trust. Perhaps you should try a
more direct approach. <br/>
ARCHER: What do you mean? <br/>
T'POL: Ask him where the weapon is being constructed. <br/>
ARCHER: It's too risky. If he suspects something, we'll wind up right
back where we started. He'll tell me. I just need a little more time. </font></p>

neuro-physiology. It may be possible to erase his most recent memory
engrams. That way Degra will never know that he came aboard, or that he
met any of us. <br/>
ARCHER: But this is a Xindi reptilian. Would it work on a primate? <br/>

perform a few tests, but I don't expect it will be a problem. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DEGRA: The planet was barely habitable. <br/>
ARCHER: Why'd you live there? <br/>
DEGRA: It wasn't by choice. Naara was desperate to leave, she didn't
think a military habitat was the right environment for the children. Do
you have a family, Captain? <br/>
ARCHER: It's been a long time since anyone called me Captain. It's
Jonathan, remember? I never really had an opportunity to start one. I
was away from home a lot. <br/>
DEGRA: You should make the time. I've learned that our work, in the
end, means very little. Our real legacy is the children. I would do
anything to protect mine. After I was told of the threat from humanity
I left my theoretical studies and agreed to design the prototype
weapon. When it arrived in your star system, I watched the incoming
telemetry with the other members of the Council. Seven million lives
were extinguished in front of my eyes. I asked myself how many of those
were children. I suppose I've told you this before. <br/>
ARCHER: Actually, you haven't. <br/>
DEGRA: Three years. My children may not even recognise me after so
much. <br/>
ARCHER: We're being hailed. Whoever it is, they must be pretty far
away. I'll try to clear it up. <br/>
THALEN [OC]: Transmission. This is Thalen responding to your distress
call. Please acknowledge. <br/>
DEGRA: It's one of my colleagues. <br/>(He opens a channel.) <br/>DEGRA: Thalen, can you
hear me? It's Degra. <br/>
THALEN [OC]: Degra? It's good to hear your voice. I'd heard from my
sources </font></p>

THALEN [OC]: I'm on Azati Prime. It's safe here. <br/>
DEGRA: Is my family still there, are they safe? Thalen! <br/>
THALEN [OC]: Naara is here, and the children. I'll tell them to expect
you. <br/>(Fades into gibberish.)<br/>
ARCHER: At least you know they're all right. <br/>
DEGRA: There were more than a thousand primates and arboreals at that
colony. I don't understand why it wasn't destroyed. </font></p>

DEGRA: You must forgive me. To me, it's been only a day since we were
enemies. Giving you the coordinates to a classified installation is
difficult. <br/>

ARCHER: When did you realise. <br/>
DEGRA: I had my suspicions from the beginning, but it was the comm.
signal from my colleague on Azati Prime that confirmed them. <br/>
ARCHER: We know your ship has been there, recently. <br/>
DEGRA: There's an Insectoid deuterium facility on Azati Prime. That's
the last place my people would have gone to hide from them. If it
weren't for that one mistake, your plan might have succeeded. <br/>
ARCHER: You gave us the coordinates of a red giant. <br/>
DEGRA: I gave you what you thought you wanted. <br/>
ARCHER: I guess I'll just have to wipe your memory clean again, go back
into the simulator and start this whole thing over. <br/>
DEGRA: I doubt there's time for that. We both know my people are
searching for me. <br/>
ARCHER: I think you didn't figure it out until after the malfunction.
I'd be willing to bet those co-ordinates are real. <br/>
DEGRA: Then I suggest you proceed there at maximum warp. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HOSHI: Why would he encrypt the coordinates if
they weren't accurate? <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps he thought it would make them appear more convincing.<br/>
TUCKER: He's got to be lying, sir. Something must have happened during
the radiation surge that tipped him off. <br/>
ARCHER: We can't afford to lose three weeks if the weapon isn't there.
Have you learned anything more about how they open the subspace
vortices? <br/>
TUCKER: They use some kind of phase deflector pulses. Once they're in,
their ships can travel half a dozen light years in a couple of minutes.

THALEN: Yes. <br/>

main deflector to open a subspace vortex. <br/>
