warship - Bridge]</b> </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (We enter a world of tangled metal, fires, and
blue-skinned bodies slumped across consoles. One manages to get up and
activate a communications panel.) <br/>
SHRAN: Bridge to Engineering. Engineering, respond! <br/>
(No reply, so he goes to another console.) <br/>
SHRAN: This is the warship Kumari calling Imperial Command. We've been
attacked by a Tellarite vessel. Primary systems have failed! Request
immediate <br/>
(He's interrupted by an explosion.) <br/>
COMPUTER: Alert. Warp containment breach in two minutes. <br/>
SHRAN: Tellarite swine! They will pay for this. This is Shran. All crew
to the escape pods! Abandon ship. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HOSHI: The food on this ship isn't fit for animals!
That mangy pet of yours would probably taste better. You can either
take me home or find a new chef, it's that simple. Oh, something else.
I want new quarters. <br/>
ARCHER: Is that so. <br/>
HOSHI: For one thing, my room is too small. There are plasma conduits
running across the ceiling. It's noisy, it keeps me up all night. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe you'd sleep better in the Cargo bay. <br/>
HOSHI: What did you say to me? <br/>
ARCHER: This is a Starship, not a luxury liner. If you're not satisfied
with the accommodations, we can leave you behind in a shuttlepod. Maybe
you'll have better luck with whoever picks you up. And if you don't
like Chef's food, don't eat it. From the looks of things, you should
probably skip the dessert table while you're at it. <br/>
HOSHI: That was a nice touch. <br/>
ARCHER: I can't believe I'm supposed to speak to their ambassador like
that. <br/>
HOSHI: Tellarites always have a litany of complaints. It's how they
start arguments with people they've just met. <br/>
ARCHER: Even if they have nothing to complain about? <br/>
HOSHI: In that case, they'll just insult you. Whatever they say, you
have to respond in kind. Otherwise, they'll take offense. <br/>
ARCHER: A species that actually thrives on arguing. They probably make
good politicians. Thanks for the dry run. <br/>
HOSHI: Sir. I wasn't kidding about Porthos. <br/>
ARCHER: You think he's mangy? <br/>
HOSHI: No, but you might want to keep him out of sight. Tellarites
consider canines something of a delicacy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's starlog, November 12, 2154. We've arrived
in orbit of Tellar Prime. Starfleet's ordered us to transport their
ambassador to a neutral planet designated as Babel, where Earth
mediators will try to settle a long-standing trade dispute between the
Tellarites and the Andorians. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARCHER: Everything ready for our guests? <br/>
TUCKER: Well, just about. But my people are working triple shifts
trying to finish that mud bath they wanted. <br/>
ARCHER: Mud bath? <br/>
TUCKER: Apparently the ambassador likes a good soak in the morning.
Something I don't understand. These Tellarites have warp ships, so why
do we have to take them to the conference? <br/>
ARCHER: Babel's on the far side of Andorian space. They won't allow
Tellarite ships to pass through their territory. <br/>
TUCKER: Now we're a shuttle service. When are we going to get back to
exploring? </font></p>

Archer. Welcome aboard. <br/>
GRAL: Ambassador Gral. <br/>
(The handshake turns into a test of strength.) <br/>
GRAL: I'm told this ship is the pride of Starfleet. I find it small and
unimpressive. <br/>
ARCHER: Funny. I was about to say the same thing about you. <br/>
GRAL: (smiling) You may show us to our quarters. It's far too cold in here. <br/>
NAARG: We're expected to stay on this ship for five days? </font></p>

it. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Archer enters.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
ARCHER: Warm enough? <br/>
T'POL: The Ambassador requested the temperature be increased. <br/>
ARCHER: Again? <br/>
TUCKER: You know, I like these people more than I thought I would. They
don't hold anything back. It's refreshing, speaking your mind for a
change. <br/>
ARCHER: You don't feel free to speak your mind with the rest of us? <br/>
TUCKER: No, you know what I mean. <br/>
ARCHER: No. Maybe you'd like to explain it to me. Why don't you change
your uniform before you stink up the place. <br/>
TUCKER: Ah, practicing your Tellarite. I get it. <br/>(Tucker leaves, hoping he
really does get it.) <br/>
ARCHER: When in Rome. <br/>
T'POL: I beg your pardon? <br/>
ARCHER: Forget it. <br/>
T'POL: The Ambassador wants to speak with you. <br/>
ARCHER: What a surprise. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Gral is standing by a window.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
GRAL: Have we crossed into Andorian space? <br/>
ARCHER: A few minutes ago. <br/>
GRAL: The last time I was here, I was on the Command deck of one of our
cruisers, driving those blue demons back into their territory. The
Andorians came to your aid during the Xindi crisis. <br/>
ARCHER: They helped save my planet. <br/>
GRAL: So why should we trust humans to mediate this dispute? You owe
them your lives. <br/>
ARCHER: Earth wants a peaceful outcome just as much as you do. That
isn't going to happen if we choose sides. <br/>
GRAL: Your people have no experience in interstellar affairs. <br/>
ARCHER: It doesn't seem that you have a lot of other options. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Gral returns to the main table set with brightly coloured foods.)

GRAL: Your Chef obviously went to a great deal of trouble. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm told these are authentic Tellarite dishes. <br/>
GRAL: If I'd wanted to eat like this, I would've stayed at home. I was
expecting to sample Earth cuisine on this journey. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll have him whip something up. <br/>
HOSHI [OC]: Captain Archer to the Bridge. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HOSHI: We've picked up a message on an Andorian
channel. <br/>
SHRAN [OC]: Kumari calling Imperial Command. Been attacked. Primary
systems have failed. Request immediate. <br/>
HOSHI: That's it. <br/>
TRAVIS: They have no ships within range. <br/>
ARCHER: How long to intercept them at maximum warp? <br/>
TRAVIS: Two hours. <br/>
ARCHER: Alter course. Contact Babel. Let them know we're going to be
delayed. <br/>
(Two hours later -) <br/>
REED: Judging by the debris pattern, I'd say their reactor breached. <br/>
T'POL: I'm detecting significant quantities of duranium alloy. This was
most likely an Andorian combat vessel. <br/>
REED: Escape pods. Multiple biosigns. <br/>
ARCHER: Bring them into the Launch bay. Tell Phlox to stand by for
casualties. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The place is full of injured Andorians, and Shran
is keeping close watch as Phlox examines a young woman.) <br/>
PHLOX: This would be easier if you'd take a few steps back. <br/>
SHRAN: I hope you've studied Andorian physiology. <br/>(Archer and T'Pol
enter.) <br/>SHRAN: How many of my crew did you rescue?
<br/>ARCHER: Nineteen. <br/>
SHRAN: Our complement was eighty six. <br/>
ARCHER: Your distress call said you were attacked. <br/>
SHRAN: Tellarites! We were escorting our Ambassador to the trade
conference when they dropped out of warp. The Ambassador's ship was
destroyed in seconds. Tellarites crippled us with their next shot. I've
never seen one of their vessels manoeuvre like this one. While those
barbarians have been talking peace, they've obviously been improving
their warships. <br/>
T'POL: Why would the Tellarites agree to let Earth mediate your dispute
if they were planning this strike? <br/>
SHRAN: Perhaps you should ask them. I suggest you scan for our data
recorder. It'll contain the sensor logs of the attack. <br/>(T'Pol leaves.)
<br/>SHRAN: We seem to keep running into each other, Captain. It's fortunate
Enterprise was close by. <br/>
ARCHER: It's not a coincidence. We're carrying the Tellarite
delegation. <br/>
SHRAN: They're aboard this ship? <br/>
ARCHER: These aren't the people who attacked you. <br/>
SHRAN: They may know who did. <br/>
ARCHER: Shran! <br/>(Archer stops him from storming out.) <br/>ARCHER: You're on my ship. <br/>
SHRAN: You better keep them away from us or there will be bloodshed. </font></p>

damage is consistent with Tellarite particle cannons. <br/>
ARCHER: What about the black box? <br/>
T'POL: The memory core was damaged, but I was able to reconstruct the
last few seconds of sensor data. <br/>

to do with this alleged attack. <br/>
ARCHER: The Andorian sensor logs. Look them over yourself. <br/>
GRAL: Logs can be fabricated. <br/>
ARCHER: You saw the debris field. <br/>
GRAL: For all we know, they destroyed the ship themselves. Andorian
technology is more advanced than ours. One of our cruisers wouldn't
stand a chance against two of theirs! <br/>
ARCHER: I want you to speak to your people. Find out what you can. <br/>
GRAL: I am not comfortable with so many Andorians aboard. Contact your
superiors. Have them transferred to another vessel. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's get something straight. You're just a passenger on my
ship. I give the orders. <br/>
GRAL: Where are you taking them? <br/>
ARCHER: Back to Andoria. <br/>

this incident. <br/>

Andorian Ale.) <br/>
SHRAN: To the Kumari. <br/>
ARCHER: From what I saw, she was a fine ship with a good crew. <br/>
SHRAN: I was in command for twelve years. First ship of her class. Most of
the crew I served with even longer. They were more than colleagues. I
knew their spouses, their children. I'm grateful Talas survived. If I'd
lost her<br/>
ARCHER: I didn't realise there was something going on between the two
of you. <br/>
SHRAN: It's a recent development. In the past, I never would've
considered a relationship with someone under my command. <br/>
ARCHER: What changed? <br/>
SHRAN: Andorian women are far more aggressive than Earth females. She
made an overture. I had a choice. Charge her with assaulting a superior
or mate with her. <br/>
ARCHER: I hope you made the right decision. <br/>
SHRAN: I regret that you're drawn into another of our conflicts,
Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: I seem to have a knack for it. <br/>
SHRAN: I doubt that war can be avoided this time. When that sensor data
is seen by Imperial Command. <br/>
ARCHER: It doesn't make sense. Why agree to a conference, then attack
your ambassador? <br/>
SHRAN: Tellarites don't think like you or I do. They've been provoking
us for months. We've lost six freighters along the border. We know
they're responsible. <br/>
ARCHER: Tellarites claim they've lost ships of their own. <br/>
SHRAN: You'd accept their word over ours? <br/>

ARCHER: Your government asked us to be a part of a conference, and now
you're attacking us! <br/>

lure you into a trap. <br/>
SHRAN: We have no argument with Starfleet. <br/>
GRAL: Your people tried to destroy this ship! <br/>
SHRAN: Captain, I assure you, what happened does not represent the will
or intent of my government. <br/>
GRAL Admit the truth. The Imperial Guard never wanted this conference
to take place. They've obviously taken matters into their own hands. <br/>
SHRAN: Are you implying the Imperial Guard's been disloyal? <br/>
GRAL: I don't have to imply anything. The facts speak for themselves. <br/>
SHRAN: That may not have been an Andorian ship. <br/>
ARCHER: What? <br/>
SHRAN: Its shield matrix had a completely different configuration. <br/>
GRAL: What is that supposed to prove? <br/>
SHRAN: Several of our warships have been reported missing over the
years. The Tellarites could have taken one of them, enhanced its
systems. <br/>
GRAL: He's suffering from paranoia, Captain. <br/>
SHRAN: I'm not paranoid. Your people are trying to kill us! <br/>

They can't be trusted. Your desire for a peaceful resolution is
blinding you from the truth! <br/>

Archer be so blind. <br/>

that mistake again. With the appropriate persuasion, Gral will talk. <br/>

appear to be Tellarite or Andorian. <br/>
ARCHER: Do we have any idea who built it? <br/>
T'POL: There's a remote possibility. Its power matrix utilises boridium
cells. We encountered a similar technology more than two years ago. <br/>
ARCHER: The Romulan minefield. But the power cells on those mines were
much larger and more primitive. <br/>
T'POL: I did say it was a remote possibility. <br/>
ARCHER: If this is a Romulan ship, why would they be stirring up
trouble so far from home? <br/>
T'POL: They have been known to act aggressively against species they
see as a threat. <br/>
ARCHER: We've never threatened them. As far as I know, neither have the
Andorians or Tellarites. Maybe they're afraid of something else. The
species in this region have a history of not getting along. This
conference could've been the first step in changing that. <br/>
T'POL: You believe they fear an alliance? <br/>
ARCHER: The conference has been postponed indefinitely. It doesn't
sound like there's going to be an alliance any time soon. Anything from
Trip? <br/>

REED: Perhaps it's on one of the lower levels. There's no rule that
says the bridge has to be at the top of the ship. <br/>

Bridge. <br/>
