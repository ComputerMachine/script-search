took Trip to see before she got married. Underground, a man is
squeezing himself through tunnels that have at least been modified by
people, judging by the shapes of the openings. He finds a box with the
bust of a male carved on top of it, and begins to gently brush off the
dust of the ages to reveal an inscription.) <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Admiral Maxwell Forrest's Personal Log. I've
arrived on Vulcan, hopeful that the High Command is finally ready to
conduct joint missions with Starfleet. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SOVAL: Admiral, the High Command will tell you its
decision at the proper time. <br/>
FORREST: After all we've been through, I'd rather hear the good news
from you. <br/>
SOVAL: The High Command hasn't included me in their discussions. <br/>
FORREST: They're not telling their own Ambassador to Earth what they're
planning? Welcome to the club. <br/>
SOVAL: Admiral, I know you find our reluctance to share technology and
discoveries restrictive. <br/>
FORREST: I can think of a few stronger words than that. <br/>
SOVAL: We don't know what to do about humans. Of all the species we've
made contact with, yours is the only one we can't define. You have the
arrogance of Andorians, the stubborn pride of Tellarites. One moment,
you're as driven by your emotions as Klingons, and the next, you
confound us by suddenly embracing logic. <br/>
FORREST :I'm sure those qualities are found in every species. <br/>
(They pass through the retina scanner at the Embassy security check.) <br/>
SOVAL: Not in such confusing abundance. <br/>
FORREST: Ambassador. Are Vulcans afraid of humans? Why? <br/>
SOVAL: Because there is one species you remind us of. <br/>
FORREST: Vulcans. <br/>
SOVAL: We had our wars, Admiral, just as humans did. Our planet was
devastated, our civilisation nearly destroyed. Logic saved us. But it
took almost fifteen hundred years for us to rebuild our world and
travel to the stars. You humans did the same in less than a century.
There are those on the High Command who wonder what humans would
achieve in the century to come, and they don't like the answer. <br/>
FORREST: We're not the Klingons. We only want to be your partners. To
do what the nations of Earth have learned to do. To work together in
common cause. <br/>
SOVAL: Unfortunately, the future of relations between our worlds is not
mine to control. <br/>
(There's a dull thud sound. Max looks back then suddenly grabs Soval
and pushes him to the floor as the dust from an explosion billows
towards them and the building starts to fall apart. Then there is a
second explosion, and the top of the Embassy is blown off.)

who easily puts it through the hoop.) <br/>
TUCKER: That's another game. Twenty one to two. <br/>
HOSHI: Time to switch sides again, Doctor. <br/>
PHLOX: Certainly. This is a most enjoyable sport. Reminiscent of Octran
fertility contests. <br/>

I'm going to need you on the investigation full-time. <br/>
T'POL: That's where I prefer to be. <br/>
ARCHER: Your mother and husband will understand? <br/>
(They arrive at the airlock and Archer works the console.) <br/>
T'POL: My mother hasn't responded to my communiqués. It's not unusual
for her to become lost in her work. As for my husband, our arrangement
remains unchanged. <br/>
V'LAS: Captain Jonathan Archer, I regret we meet under such tragic
circumstances. <br/>
T'POL: I'd like to introduce Administrator V'Las. <br/>
ARCHER: Administrator. I wasn't told to expect the head of the High
Command. <br/>
SOVAL: Captain Archer, all of Vulcan grieves with you today. <br/>
ARCHER: Twelve Vulcans died in the blast, Ambassador. <br/>
V'LAS: To that end, this is Stel, Chief Investigator of our Security
Directorate. <br/>
STEL: (a young man) Captain, we now have suspects. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Conference room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARCHER: Andorians? Why would they attack our
embassy? <br/>
STEL: To create conflict between Earth and Vulcan. <br/>
SOVAL: They do consider us allies who stand against them. <br/>
ARCHER: So far, we've done our best to remain neutral, and the
Andorians know that. They have nothing to gain by attacking us. <br/>
T'POL: You have other suspects? <br/>
STEL: Syrrannites. <br/>
ARCHER: I've never heard of that species. <br/>
T'POL: Actually, they're a small group of Vulcans. They follow a
corrupted form of Surak's teachings. <br/>
ARCHER: Surak I've heard of. He's the father of Vulcan logic. <br/>
V'LAS: Even after eighteen hundred years, we consider him the most
important Vulcan who ever lived. <br/>
ARCHER: So why would these Syrrannites want to attack our embassy? It's
hardly an act of logic. <br/>
SOVAL: They've been vocal about their opposition to government, but
always peaceful. <br/>
STEL: Over the past year their leader, a dissident named Syrran, has
become a dangerous zealot. <br/>
V'LAS: Captain, I trust you to keep this matter confidential. We don't
share it lightly. But recently, on our world, there have been instances
of violence against non-Vulcans. Though we have no conclusive proof,
there are signs that Syrrannites might be responsible. <br/>
ARCHER: Is there any evidence connecting Syrrannites to the bombing? <br/>
SOVAL: Your embassy is officially considered to be on Earth soil. We've
preserved the site for you to investigate. <br/>
V'LAS: If evidence is there, the Chief Investigator and I feel
confident you'll find it. <br/>
ARCHER: I intend to. </font></p>

(They pick their way carefully through the twisted wreckage, using
torches and scanners.) <br/>
TRAVIS: Schematics say the secondary security bank's right in there. <br/>
REED: Still in one piece. <br/>
TRAVIS: There's a weak power signature under this mess. <br/>
REED: It's probably an emergency light running on batteries. Well,
there's something here. Some kind of surveillance recorder. <br/>
(Travis lifts a piece of debris to reveal a device.) <br/>
TRAVIS: Lieutenant. <br/>
REED: The timer might be broken, but that bomb's armed. Don't move. The
slightest vibration might set it off. Reed to Enterprise. I need an
emergency transporter lock. Two to beam up on my mark. <br/>
HOSHI [OC]: Acknowledged. <br/>
TRAVIS: Why not beam the bomb out of here? <br/>
REED: If there's a gravity switch, it'll detonate in the matter stream.
<br/>
HOSHI [OC]: Enterprise to Reed. The transporter's locked. Do you need
assistance? <br/>
REED: Negative, Enterprise. Stand by. <br/>
(He puts the open communicator on his shoulder, like a phone.) <br/>
REED: I'm going to attempt to scan it. <br/>
TRAVIS: Attempt? <br/>
REED: Yeah. If I had designed that bomb, I'd rig it to go off the
instant a sensor beam made contact. Look on the bright side. If it
detonates, we'll never know. Steady. There's Vulcan DNA on these
controls. So much for blaming Andorians. Boosting scan resolution. <br/>
(The lights on the device start flashing.)<br/>
TRAVIS: That can't be good. <br/>

PHLOX: According to the Vulcan Genome Registry, the DNA on the bomb's
controls was left by this woman. T'Pau. <br/>
(The image of a young woman is on his overhead monitor.) <br/>
ARCHER: Since you had her DNA on record, does that mean she's been
arrested before? <br/>
T'POL: The Registry records DNA from all Vulcans at birth. <br/>
ARCHER: Do you know anything about her? <br/>
STEL: T'Pau is a well-known Syrrannite. <br/>
ARCHER: All right. We've got a solid start. Now we need to find her. <br/>
STEL: Captain, T'Pau is Vulcan. The Security Directorate will take
charge of the investigation. <br/>
ARCHER: Of course. Vulcan sovereignty. Lieutenant Reed and Commander
T'Pol will work with you. <br/>
STEL: Their assistance isn't required. <br/>
ARCHER: Chief Investigator. Forty three people died in the bombing.
Twelve Vulcans and thirty one humans. We want her as much as you do. <br/>
STEL: This is now a Vulcan security operation. We'll inform Ambassador
Soval of any developments that concern you. </font></p>

with flag draped coffins laid out in rows of seven. Archer walks to the
third one in on the second row from the door and places his hands on
it. The bay doors open and close again.) <br/>
SOVAL: His death is a loss to both our worlds. <br/>
ARCHER: If you're lost, Ambassador, I can direct you to your shuttle. <br/>
SOVAL: He saved my life in the explosion. He could have saved himself. <br/>
ARCHER: He always put the mission first. <br/>
SOVAL: The last time we spoke, he was anticipating the prospect of
joint missions. Humans and Vulcans working together. <br/>
ARCHER: We have to make that possible, despite the High Command. <br/>
SOVAL: It makes no sense to think the Syrrannites are responsible for
this outrage. <br/>
ARCHER: We have DNA evidence. <br/>
SOVAL: Recheck everything, Captain, question everything, and don't let
them keep you on Enterprise. The answers you need are on Vulcan, and
however far you have to take this investigation, you have my support. </font></p>

KOSS: It is agreeable to see you. <br/>

T'POL: What is the purpose of your visit? <br/>
KOSS: Does a husband need a purpose to visit his wife? <br/>
T'POL: Your message was cryptic. <br/>
KOSS: By necessity. The Syrrannite threat has brought new security
measures into effect. Private communications are no longer private. <br/>
T'POL: You have something to tell me that the authorities shouldn't
hear? <br/>
KOSS: Something to give you. Your mother asked me to deliver it
personally. She told me that it's been in your family for generations,
and now it's your turn to care for it. <br/>
(He hands over a box containing an IDIC - a circle intersected by a
triangle, with a stone at the centre.) <br/>

hiding to avoid arrest. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARCHER: A Syrrannite? And she never told you? <br/>
T'POL: What's important is that she's disappeared like the others
facing unjustified arrest. <br/>
ARCHER: Like T'Pau. <br/>
T'POL: No, there's a difference. My mother wants me to find her. <br/>
(She shows him the medallion.) <br/>
T'POL: It's called an IDIC. <br/>
ARCHER: Looks old. <br/>
T'POL: It's been modified. <br/>
(She presses something and the central stone projects a holographic
map.) <br/>
T'POL: This is a desert called the Forge. The route's the one Surak
supposedly followed. <br/>
ARCHER: Eighteen hundred years ago? <br/>
T'POL: Syrrannites follow the same path today, seeking enlightenment. <br/>
ARCHER: And you think your mother is somewhere along that path? <br/>
T'POL: She told Koss this was a family heirloom, but I've never seen it
before. <br/>
ARCHER: She didn't want Koss to know about the map. With any luck, we
can use this to find your mother, and T'Pau. </font></p>

bad, technology won't work. So, no communicators, no scanners, no

journey into the Forge. <br/>
ARCHER: You keep saying supposedly. You don't believe Surak did the
things they said he did? <br/>
T'POL: He brought logic to Vulcan, in an age we call the Time of
Awakening, but his writings from that period no longer exist. <br/>
ARCHER: There must be some record of it. <br/>
T'POL: Over the centuries, his followers made copies of his teachings. <br/>

TUCKER: You say you found an anomaly. <br/>
PHLOX: In these chromosomal fragments. Here, and here. <br/>
REED: What kind of anomaly? <br/>
PHLOX: These are telomeres. A genetic clock, if you will. Each time a
cell divides, they grow shorter. <br/>
TUCKER: Sure. That's how you tell how old someone is from a cell
sample. <br/>
PHLOX: Though T'Pau's current age is thirty two standard years, her DNA
recovered from the bomb has an age of only a few months. <br/>
TUCKER: They used the DNA they sampled when she was registered as a
baby. <br/>
PHLOX: Precisely. The evidence implicating T'Pau is false. <br/>
TUCKER: Captain Archer's gone after the wrong person. <br/>
REED: And there's no way to get word to him. <br/>

signature was recorded. <br/>
PHLOX: Undoubtedly another fabrication. <br/>
TUCKER: But look, the guard recognised whoever it was. And that guard
is your patient. <br/>
PHLOX: Corporal Askwith? <br/>
TUCKER: He could be our only chance to identify who really planted the

PHLOX: He's in a coma. His cranial injuries are substantial. I don't
expect him to recover. <br/>

AREV: Vulcans do not lie. <br/>
ARCHER: I've dealt with the High Command. Vulcans can lie and cheat

humans are their allies. <br/>

(They block the entrance with a stones. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arev
sees T'Pol's medallion.) </font><br/>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AREV:
I know this. How did you get this medallion? <br/>
T'POL: From my mother. <br/>
AREV: T'Les. <br/>
T'POL: You're a Syrrannite. <br/>
AREV: The daughter of T'Les serves on a human starship. <br/>
T'POL: When did you talk with her? Is she safe? <br/>
AREV: You're the human responsible for the destruction of the monastery
at P'Jem. <br/>
ARCHER: Is that going to be a problem? <br/>
AREV: The High Command defiled P'Jem when they used it to spy on
Andoria. You exposed their hypocrisy. <br/>
ARCHER: You seem to know a lot about us. I'm guessing that means you
know why we're here. <br/>
AREV: Your mother is safe with the others, at the T'Kareth sanctuary.
It's not far. I'll guide you both there when the storm has passed.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOVAL: I don't know if this has ever been attempted
with a human before. <br/>
(He puts his fingers on Askwith's face, then glares at Tucker to stop
looking over his shoulder.) <br/>
SOVAL: My mind to your mind. Our minds are one. Our thoughts are
joined. Yes. <br/>
(Flashes of the Embassy check point.) <br/>
SOVAL: I see what you see. The embassy. I'm at my station. At your
station. So many new people arriving for the summit. I don't recognise
them all, but some I know. A package. That's all right. I don't need to
see it. Go right through. Who are you? Who? <br/>
(Suddenly he disconnects from Askwith.) <br/>
TUCKER: Ambassador. What'd you see? </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The group share a meal.) <br/>
ARCHER: How long do these sand-fire storms usually last? <br/>
AREV: A day. Perhaps two. I've never seen one this strong. But we're
safe here, and we're in no hurry. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe we should be. <br/>
T'POL: The High Command believes the Syrrannites are responsible for
bombing the Earth embassy. <br/>
AREV: That's not our way. <br/>
ARCHER: They seem to think that it is. That you and your leader believe
in a corrupted version of Surak's teachings. <br/>
AREV: Did your mother tell you the story? <br/>
T'POL: Of the IDIC? <br/>
AREV: Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combination. Words that are a mere
shadow of its true meaning. (she hands it over) Surak tells us that the
story of the IDIC has no end. But it begins here, at Mount Seleya. <br/>
T'POL: Surak died on Mount Seleya. <br/>
AREV: His body, yes, but his katra was spirited away before the last
battle against those who marched beneath the Raptor's wings. Those who
wanted to return to the savage ways. <br/>
ARCHER: What's a katra? <br/>
T'POL: Syrrannites claim it's the essence of a Vulcan mind. That it can
be transferred from the body before death, then stored in some manner. <br/>
AREV: Some say Surak's katra was found, and now is carried by a
Syrrannite so all those who meld with him may touch Surak's mind. <br/>
ARCHER: Syrrannite's conduct mind-melding? <br/>
AREV: Surak tells us it is the heritage of every Vulcan. Even those who
don't believe in the practise. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STEL: A witness? <br/>
TUCKER: The guard recognised the person who brought in the bomb we
found in the rubble. <br/>
STEL: The Syrrannite woman, T'Pau. <br/>
SOVAL: No. It was you. <br/>
STEL: I would like to interrogate this witness myself. <br/>
TUCKER: You're not getting anywhere near him. <br/>
V'LAS: Perhaps I could speak with the guard. <br/>
PHLOX: I'm afraid he's in no condition to be questioned. He's in a
coma. <br/>
V'LAS: Yet he provided an eyewitness account. <br/>
TUCKER: We accessed his memories through a mind-meld. <br/>
STEL: Telepathic evidence is inadmissible. <br/>
V'LAS: It's not evidence at all! You allowed this distasteful act to
take place? <br/>
SOVAL: I performed it. <br/>
V'LAS: Soval. You've shamed Vulcan and yourself. The law leaves me no
recourse. You'll be summoned to appear before the High Command to
account for your actions. Commander. Doctor. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AREV: At one time, the High Command was only
responsible for the exploration of space. But that's changed. <br/>
ARCHER: I've been told Vulcans have never been explorers. <br/>
AREV: I think you've been told many things about us that aren't true. <br/>
(The sand-fire blows a hole in the entrance.) <br/>
AREV: Reseal the entrance! <br/>
(As they gather the stones, T'Pol is hit by lightning.) <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pol! <br/>

ARCHER: Easy, easy, easy. <br/>
AREV: (at the entrance) Listen. The storm is gaining strength. <br/>

him.) <br/>

SOVAL: I'm not a fool, Commander. V'Las was involved with the attack on
your embassy. He's responsible for blaming it on the Syrrannites. <br/>
TUCKER: Then why turn yourself over to him? <br/>
SOVAL: It's the only chance I'll have to reach the rest of the High
Command. <br/>
TUCKER: What if they're all in on it? (silence) If you really want
humans and Vulcans to work together someday, you might start thinking
about trusting us. <br/>
SOVAL Peace and long life, Commander. <br/>

T'POL: Are you injured? <br/>
ARCHER: I'm fine. He said something in Vulcan. Vokau. <br/>
T'POL: Remember. Remember what? <br/>
ARCHER: I think he punched me. The storm's over? <br/>
T'POL: The patrol craft are flying again. They sound like they're
closing in on this

ARCHER: He said we weren't far from the T'Kareth Sanctuary. We should
keep moving. <br/>

trails pass overhead.) <br/>
ARCHER: They're following a grid search pattern. No sensors, but they
can still make visual contact. We have to find cover before the sun
comes up. That way. <br/>

ARCHER: That's where the Syrrannites are. <br/>
