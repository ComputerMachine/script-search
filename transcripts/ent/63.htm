up and a man gets out, carrying a folder. He crosses the street and
goes into an apartment block. Up in his room, he bolts and chains the
door and gets a beer from the fridge. There's the remains of an old
pizza in the bathroom. He takes a bite. The telephone rings.) </font>

LOOMIS: Yeah, yeah, it's all set, just like we discussed.<br/>

The same. Be careful with the sedative. You nearly killed the last one.

other comes over.)<br/>

<br/>GEORGIA: Hey, I know you from this morning. You brought me the apple juice.<br/>

GEORGIA: At the clinic? <br/>
LOOMIS: Oh, yeah. Now I remember. Small world, huh? <br/>

GEORGIA: How the hell would you remember that? <br/>(Loomis pulls in to the
side.) <br/>GEORGIA: Er, it's another two blocks. <br/>(He gets out a bottle and a cloth.)
<br/>GEORGIA: If that's drugs, I am not interested. What you got in there? <br/>
LOOMIS: Come here. <br/>(There's a brief struggle as he puts the
chloroform-laden cloth over her mouth, then she passes out.) <br/>LOOMIS: There you

(to Porthos) Good boy. Cheese? <br/>(Archer throws a piece and Porthos catches it.) <br/>ARCHER: This is
your last piece. <br/>
DANIELS: It's okay. How've you been, Jon? <br/>
ARCHER: About time you showed up. Our mission's changed quite a bit
since the last time I saw you, but I suppose you're aware of it. <br/>
DANIELS: I am. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe you could fill in a few of the blanks for me. The Xindi
weapon would be a good place to start. <br/>
DANIELS: We don't know any more than you do. <br/>
ARCHER: I thought you and your colleagues were supposed to be keeping
an eye on the time line. You're from the thirtieth century. Hasn't all
this happened already? <br/>
DANIELS: History doesn't mention anything about a conflict between
humans and Xindi. <br/>
ARCHER: How could that be? <br/>
DANIELS: The events that are taking place are the result of temporal
incursions. They are not supposed to be happening. <br/>
ARCHER: But they are happening. <br/>
DANIELS: Yes, they are, but the outcome hasn't reached us yet. It takes
a while for changes to ripple through the time line. <br/>
ARCHER: The time traveller, the man the Suliban worked for. <br/>
DANIELS: What about him? <br/>
ARCHER: He's the one who told us about the weapon being built. Should I
believe him?<br/>
DANIELS: You have no reason not to.<br/>
ARCHER: You said I'm supposed to play some crucial part in history.
Does this have something to do with it? <br/>
DANIELS: I wish I could say that it does, but I don't know. I told you,
none of this was supposed to happen. <br/>
ARCHER: You're not being very helpful. Why are you here? <br/>
DANIELS: We've detected three Xindi where they're not supposed to be. <br/>
ARCHER: This Expanse is filled with Xindi. <br/>
DANIELS: I'm not talking about the Expanse. I'm talking about Detroit,
Michigan, a hundred and fifty years ago. </font></p>

ARCHER: Sorry to get you up, but this couldn't wait. <br/>
T'POL: Come in. <br/>
(Porthos makes himself right at home.) <br/>
ARCHER: I just had a visit from Daniels. I think all your doubts about
time travel are about to go out the window. <br/>
T'POL: Meaning? <br/>
ARCHER: Daniels and his team have discovered three Reptilians on Earth
in the early twenty first century. He wants to send us back to find out
what they're doing. <br/>
T'POL: Us? <br/>
ARCHER: He told me I could bring one person, no more. <br/>
T'POL: If Daniels is the time traveller he claims to be, why doesn't he
find our for himself? <br/>
ARCHER: It took him a long while to get permission to interact with me.
There are clearances. He said it would take too much time. <br/>
T'POL: I would think he would have all the time in the world. <br/>
ARCHER: He said the three Xindi travelled to Earth from our century.
They've been there for two months. They're not sight-seeing, T'Pol. We
have to find out what they're up to. <br/>
T'POL: How are we supposed to accomplish this? <br/>
ARCHER: He wants us to meet him in the Command Centre at oh eight
hundred tomorrow. (to Porthos) Come on, boy. Check the database. Find
something to wear that won't stand out in 2004. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUCKER:
Last time Daniels sent you to another century you had one hell of a
time getting back. <br/>
ARCHER: He gave me this, said he'd return us whenever we signalled him.
<br/>(Archer opens the box to show sixteen little items.) <br/>ARCHER: These are temporal tags. We can
use them to bring back anything that doesn't belong there. <br/>
TUCKER: If anyone asks where you went, what should I tell them? With
two shuttlepods in the bay it'll be hard to explain. <br/>
(T'Pol joins them, her hair covering her ears.) <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sure you'll think of something. Try to stay out of trouble.
<br/>
TUCKER: You too. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> T'POL:
We just travelled ninety light years back to Earth. <br/>
ARCHER: And a hundred and fifty years into the past. <br/>
T'POL: Forgive me if I'm not entirely convinced. <br/>
ARCHER: You will be. Come on. <br/>(They walk along scanning parked cars at
a row of meters.) <br/>ARCHER: This one has a motion activated security system. This
one too. <br/>(The third seems a good bet, and he uses the scanner to unlock
it.) <br/>ARCHER: We're in. <br/>
T'POL: This apparatus. It appears to have been designed to incapacitate
the vehicle. <br/>
(The car's been clamped. The next potential one with an open window
has a Rottweiler in it. They finally get into a truck with ladders on
the roof and a loud radio which Archer struggles to switch off) <br/>

Have you ever operated a vehicle from this period? <br/>
ARC HER: I can pilot a starship. R N D 2 3 4. <br/>
T'POL: I suggest you begin with two. <br/>
ARCHER: Foot controls. <br/>(They eventually drive off) <br/>
T'POL: I don't believe you've activated your external lighting. <br/>
ARCHER: What year is that map from? </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(T'Pol reads her PADD.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">
T'POL: 2002. It was the closest I could find in the
Starfleet database. <br/>
ARCHER: The layout shouldn't have changed a lot in two years. <br/>
T'POL: Turn starboard on twenty fourth street. <br/>
ARCHER: If that thing has a scanning radius of three kilometres, how
far are we going to have to drive to cover the entire city? <br/>
T'POL: I have created a search grid that requires a journey of
approximately eighty kilometres, but it's probably we'll find them
before we complete it. <br/>
(Later, a light has come on on the dashboard.)<br/>
T'POL: What's that icon? <br/>
ARCHER: It's a gasoline pump. We need to get fuel. <br/>
T'POL: Where? <br/>
ARCHER: Where isn't the problem. We're going to need money. US
currency. <br/>
T'POL: That's going to be difficult at this time of night. <br/>

gave you the wrong papers to sign. <br/>
STRODE: I'm not giving the money back. <br/>
LOOMIS: No, no, no, they don't want the money back. In fact. they're
going to pay you again. Twenty five bucks. They just need you to sign
the right papers.<br/>
STRODE: You bring them? <br/>
LOOMIS: No, they wouldn't let me. You've got to do it in front of the
supervisor. You know, the fat broad that paid you. They sent me to
drive you down. <br/>
STRODE: It's eleven o'clock at night. <br/>
LOOMIS: Yeah, I know. They want to send your blood work out first thing
in the morning and they can't do it without the right paperwork. You
want the twenty five bucks or not? </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(Strode opens the door and comes out in his wheelchair.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">

LOOMIS: Well, that's not what we agreed. You said I'd get paid for each
one. <br/>
DAMRON: Bring us the last two blood types and you will be compensated. <br/>
LOOMIS: We should wait a while, a few more days at least. There was
something on the news. Cops are starting to get some complaints that
people have gone missing. <br/>
DAMRON: We can't wait a few more days. We need the last two. <br/>

T'POL: What's this? <br/>(She shows him the case of Methohexital.) <br/>
LOOMIS: Oh, I took that from the clinic. I work at the blood bank on
Porter Street. Check with them, they'll tell you. I've been there for
over a year.<br/>

acquiring methohexitol? <br/>

LOOMIS: No, no, no, no, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute, I
don't know who he is, I swear to God. A doctor, maybe. Says he's
working on a vaccine, experimental. He doesn't have approval or
something like that so he needed me to bring him people. <br/>
T'POL: Does it seem logical to you that legitimate medical research is
being conducted in an abandoned factory? <br/>
LOOMIS: I thought about that. Just tonight, I thought maybe he's some
kind of terrorist. But I swear if I knew that for a fact I never would
have agreed to help him. <br/>
T'POL: In one individual we've managed to find the worst qualities of
this era. Greed, violence, moral corruption. <br/>

hour ago. They're all okay. <br/>
ARCHER: How many? <br/>
LOOMIS: Five. No, no, six. The wheelchair guy was number six. <br/>
ARCHER: How did this doctor find you. <br/>
LOOMIS: I told you, I work at the blood bank. He wanted someone from
every blood type. Eight blood types, eight people. He figured I had
access to that kind of information. <br/></font><font face="Arial" size="2">(T'Pol hands Archer the files.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">

compunctions about abducting people? <br/>
ARCHER: What's he paying you? <br/>
LOOMIS: Five thousand apiece, double for the last three. <br/>
T'POL: Is that what human life is worth in the twenty first century? <br/>
LOOMIS: I told you, he said he wasn't going to hurt any of them. <br/>
ARCHER: What does he look like? <br/>
LOOMIS: He only calls me on the phone. I saw him a couple of times, but
he stays in the shadows. You know, he's kind of tall, that's all I can
tell you. Why don't you let me go. I swear to you, I will never do it
again. <br/>

staying out of prison. <br/>

T'POL: Drive. <br/>
LOOMIS: Ten grand a piece for the last three and I'm not going to see a
penny of it. <br/>
T'POL: Don't speak until we're out of visual range. </font></p>

REPTILIAN: (to other Reptilian) Fifteen millilitres from the new
arrival. <br/>

and the blood sample drawn.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> LOOMIS:
You catch these guys and I get immunity, right. We're not talking about
copping to a lesser charge. <br/>
T'POL: When my associate returns we'll discuss the details. <br/>
LOOMIS: Hey, I'm taking a big chance here, okay? If your associate
doesn't catch them, they're going to come looking for me, okay? You two
have to keep your word. <br/>
T'POL: You've been abducting people for money and you're questioning
our honesty? <br/>
(On the warehouse, Archer disentangles himself from the wires and IV
and starts following the Reptilians through the building using the
scanner. He has his phase pistol ready.)<br/>
T'POL: Sit back. <br/>
LOOMIS: Relax, just getting a smoke. </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(T'Pol stares in horror at him lighting up.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">
T'POL: What are you doing? <br/>
LOOMIS: I don't know about you, honey, but I'm a little tense. know
what I mean? <br/>

LOOMIS: If you want some air, open your window. </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(She holds the phase pistol to his head.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">
T'POL: Now. <br/>

ARCHER [OC]: They brought a bio-reactor with them. They're synthesising
some kind of viral agent. </font></p>

Why would they travel back through time? <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Daniels said they might be hiding from someone. </font></p>

- looking down on the Xindi lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ARCHER:
I don't know. I was thinking about trying to take out the bio-reactor,
but I could end up spreading whatever's in there across half the city. </font></p>

factory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> T'POL:
They must have some kind of temporal beacon. If you can destroy it,
they'll have no way of getting back. </font></p>

warehouse]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> T'POL:
Modify your scanner to a delta band frequency. That should help you
locate the signal from the temporal beacon. <br/>(Loomis digs a flick knife
out from the base of the passenger sea.t) </font></p>

locates the beacon and fires his phase pistol at it. He also hits a
Xindi and starts a shooting match. The remaining two pull a metal tube
out of the middle of the machine and make a run for it. Archer jumps
down onto the floor of the lab and puts temporal tabs on the
bio-reactor and the fallen Xindi.) <br/>
ARCHER: (into communicator) They've gone out the west door. They could
be headed for the street. They have the virus. </font></p>

Trouble? <br/>

T'POL: Pull over and stop here.<br/>
LOOMIS: They give you all that fancy equipment and what good does it do
you. <br/>
T'POL: Lower your window. <br/>
LOOMIS: (winding it down) I knew your partner's plan wouldn't work. <br/>
T'POL: Be quiet. They're coming. <br/>(As soon as the building door opens,
Loomis sounds the horn.) <br/>T'POL: Stop! <br/>(Loomis swings the knife at her but misses.
She fires her phase pistol and hits one Xindi, then disarms Loomis,
adjusts the setting on her phase pistol and stuns him. Archer is in hot
pursuit of the remaining Xindi, who heads up a ladder to the roof. They
both go up another ladder.)<br/>

Xindi finds an extractor fan and takes the virus out of it's case.
Archer fires at him and he hides.) <br/>
ARCHER: He's trying to release the toxin. <br/>
T'POL: We've eliminated his only means of returning to his own century.
Perhaps he has no other choice. <br/>
ARCHER: If he's trying to destroy humanity, he's not going to be able
to do it with that. They only modified the virus for six blood types. <br/>
T'POL: If they can infect three quarters of Earth's population, it's
unlikely humans will pose a threat to them in the future. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's hope he can't see in the dark. Keep laying down fire. <br/>
(He circles around, jumping across a narrow alley to get behind and
above the Reptilian.)<br/>
ARCHER: Don't move a muscle. Drop it. Why a second weapon? Where were
you going to take it? <br/>
DAMRON: We won't allow you to destroy us. Your species is doomed.
<br/>(Damron lunges for the virus, but is shot. Nevertheless, he pushes the virus
case and it rolls towards the extractor fan. Archer grabs it before it
falls in. T'Pol tags the body.) <br/>

Cargo Bay two. I've got to get this to Phlox. <br/>
