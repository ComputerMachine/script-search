     TRAVIS: It might be helpful on movie night, if you bring a date. In case you want to steal some popcorn. <br/>
     TUCKER: Let's try it again. <br/>(Tucker gets out of the ship while Travis settles into the main seat.) <br/>TUCKER: Go ahead. <br/>
     (The outside of the front hatch fluctuates.) <br/>
     TRAVIS: Is it working? <br/>
     TUCKER: Not exactly. Shut her down. The cloaking generator's running at a hundred and ten percent, 
     and it's still not enough. Let's route more power from the warp relays. Maybe that will do the trick. <br/>
     T'POL: How soon can you launch? <br/>
     TUCKER: We're still reconfiguring the power matrix but I'm pretty confident <br/>
     T'POL: You don't have time. They're going to be executed in less than two hours. <br/>
     TUCKER: We'll get it working on our way down if we have to. Look, invisible or not, 
     this cell ship can take more of beating than our shuttlepod. <br/>
     T'POL: You're about to find out. Prepare it for launch.

     REED: Well, it may be an old trick where we come from, but maybe they haven't heard of it here. <br/>
     ARCHER: Even if we got out of the compound, we'd never make it to the shuttle. Not looking like this. 
     Genetic enhancements. Very creative, Malcolm. <br/>

     ARCHER: If I know T'Pol, she won't want to leave any contamination behind. It may take some time, 
     but she'll find a way to get everything back. Including our remains. <br/>
     REED: It's ironic. Giving our lives to protect people who want to kill us. <br/>
     ARCHER: It's a big planet, Malcolm. I'm sure they're not all like that. <br/>
     REED: I'm not afraid, sir. <br/>
     ARCHER: What if we did tell them the truth? <br/>
     REED: You said it yourself, Captain. They'd never believe us. <br/>
     ARCHER: If we show them to the shuttlepod, bring the General up to Enterprise, give him the grand tour, 
     top it off with dinner in the Captain's mess. We'd probably all have a good laugh over how he 
     almost sent us to the gallows. I've gotten plenty of lectures on cultural contamination, but 
     T'Pol never mentioned anything about sacrificing crewmen to prevent it. <br/>
     REED: If we did tell them who we are, maybe it would do them a world of good. Look what the Vulcans did for Earth. <br/>
     ARCHER: That was different. These people haven't even split the atom yet. The Vulcans waited until we were ready. 
     Until we had the ability to travel to other stars. We're doing the right thing, Malcolm. 
     I'm sorry you won't get a chance to write that report. <br/>
     REED: It could still happen, sir. I'm expecting a rescue party to come barging through that door any moment.

     TUCKER: There's a power drain in the cloaking generator. <br/>
