REED: It dropped out of warp thirty minutes ago. The pilot sent a brief
audio message. He insisted on speaking with you right away. <br/>
ARCHER: Any idea what he wants? <br/>
REED: He wouldn't say, but I did manage to find his ship design in the
Vulcan database. It's Tellarite. <br/>

of the Enterprise. What can I do for you? <br/></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A Tellarite has small eyes, tusk-like lower incisor teeth,

doing here. <br/>
ARCHER: I didn't get your name. <br/>
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: Captain Skalaar of the Tellarite Mining
Consortium. <br/>
ARCHER: We're studying this planet. I have three science teams on the
surface. We're also here for a little shore leave. <br/>
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: Shore leave? <br/>
ARCHER: Vacation. It's been a while since we've had a chance to relax. <br/>
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: In that case, I recommend you visit the
equatorial range. The view from the north summit is inspiring. <br/>
ARCHER: You've been here before? <br/>
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: Many times. I prefer to think of it as my own
personal retreat. You mustn't leave until you've experienced the
hydrothermal pools of Ren-gham. <br/>
ARCHER: Where are they? <br/>
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: The polar island chain, two hundred and twenty
seven kilometres from the southern tip of the Rykos shoreline. Look for
the pyroclastic debris field then follow the lava tubes <br/>
TUCKER: Sounds like we could use a guide. <br/>
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: I'd be happy to show you. <br/>
ARCHER: Sure we're not intruding? <br/>
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: Not at all. I'll meet you at your starboard
docking port. I'll help you plan your shore leave. </font></p>

PHLOX: That wouldn't be advisable. We'd both suffer permanent cellular
damage. <br/>
T'POL: There must be something else you can try. <br/>
PHLOX: Decon gel E may neutralise the microbe, but it will be several
hours before we know if it's effective. <br/>
T'POL: I can't stay here several hours. <br/>
PHLOX: You have little choice. This organism appears to be infectious
and humans would be far more vulnerable to it than you or I. Commander
Tucker is quite capable. If he needs your help, he knows where to find
you. <br/>(He draws a curtain between them before disrobing to apply the gel.)
<br/>PHLOX: Fortunately no one else on the surface was exposed to the microbe. I
suspect you and I were contaminated when we climbed into the second
ravine. Considering the quantity of fauna down there, I'm not at all
surprised. We were probably infected by the marsupials I found. <br/>
T'POL: I told you to leave them alone. <br/>
PHLOX: Their saliva is a natural anti-coagulant. I couldn't return to
the ship without a sample. I could use your assistance. <br/>(T'Pol pulls the
curtain back to apply the gel to his prominent ridged spine.) <br/>
T'POL: I wasn't aware a curtain was installed. <br/>
PHLOX: Not everyone is comfortable with the idea of disrobing in front
of others. <br/>
T'POL: An odd attitude for a physician. <br/>
PHLOX: It's a characteristic of Denobulan males. We're more inhibited
than our women. It's led to a number of awkward moments. My Starfleet
physical was an experience I never hope to repeat. <br/>(T'Pol is fascinated

I retrofitted her engines myself. <br/>
ARCHER: You never told me why it was impounded. <br/>
SKALAAR: My brother and I were hauling a shipment of fire-salt. I
thought I could trim two or three days off our journey by cutting
across the most insignificant corner of Klingon space. I learned very
quickly there's no thing as an insignificant corner of Klingon space.
We were lucky to escape with our lives, though we did pay a price. <br/>
ARCHER: They took your ship? <br/>
SKALAAR: And it's cargo too. My brother never forgave me. I've been
trying to find a way to get the Tezra back every since. What are you
doing! <br/>(Archer throws him to the ground and pulls a weapon.) <br/>
ARCHER: Did you really think I wanted this engine fixed? You're taking
me to be executed. <br/>
SKALAAR: Don't worry, we'll meet Goroth on time. </font></p>

the Captain. This is Phlox. <br/>

subspace beacons. There is a ship on the surface. It seems to have
suffered engine damage, but it's not Tellarite. <br/>
TUCKER: Biosigns? <br/>
REED: One. <br/>
TUCKER: Open a channel. <br/>
KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]: Yes. <br/>
TUCKER: Sorry to bother you, but we're looking for a Tellarite shuttle.
Have you seen one? <br/>
KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]: How much did the Klingons offer you? <br/>
TUCKER: Klingons? Look, there must be some sort of misunderstanding
here. We're looking for our Captain. <br/>
KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]: Your Captain. He's got a price on his head. He's
probably halfway to Klingon space by now. <br/>(Ends transmission) <br/>

TRAVIS: Less than six light years. <br/>

antimatter injector. <br/>
GAAVRIN: And I suppose you have no way of paying for it. <br/>
SKALAAR: Do you know who this is? He's the only prisoner who's ever
escaped from Rura Penthe. The Klingons are offering a fortune to get
him back. Tell him. (Archer stays quiet) Tell him! <br/>
GAAVRIN: If I give you the injector, you have to promise never to come
back here. <br/>
SKALAAR: Of course I'm coming back. You're going to be my first

GAAVRIN: That was years ago. I work here now. <br/>

conduit. <br/>

want you to leave. <br/>(Gaavrin leaves.) <br/>
ARCHER: What do you plan to do now? <br/>
SKALAAR: Get that injector and install it. <br/>
ARCHER: And then? I suppose you'll turn me over to the Klingons. I'll
be disembowelled with one of those nasty looking swords of theirs.
You'll collect your nine thousand darseks but it won't get you the
Tezra back. <br/>
SKALAAR: What are you trying to say? <br/>
ARCHER: The Klingons took your freighter, your livelihood, damaged your
relationship with your brother, and what do you get in exchange? Nine
thousand darseks. Doesn't seem like a very fair trade to me. <br/>
SKALAAR: What choice do I have? I told you, if I let you go they'd kill
me. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe not. Have you ever been aboard Goroth's ship? <br/>
