VALDORE </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Control area]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">: The
humans have seen too much. We can't allow them to escape. <br/>

ARCHER </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Ready room]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">: If
this is a Romulan ship, why would they be stirring up trouble so far
from home? <br/>

a gun to Gral) Stay out of this, pinkskin. <br/>
ARCHER: Shran, listen to me. The ship that attacked you wasn't
Tellarite. You're both being set up. Someone didn't want this
conference to go forward. <br/>

through the debris.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's starlog, supplemental. For now, the truce
between the Andorians and Tellarites on Enterprise is holding. But
Starfleet has informed me of a new diplomatic crisis. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Situation room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARCHER: It was a heavily-armed scoutship with a
crew of seventeen. There were no survivors. <br/>
TRAVIS: Why does Starfleet think this is connected to the other
incidents? <br/>
ARCHER: Rigelians transmitted a visual record of the ship that attacked
them. <br/>
(A grainy image of Enterprise is put on the monitor.) <br/>
ARCHER: I'm told their Trade Commission is demanding compensation, and
my arrest. Whoever's behind these attacks, they're trying to do more
than provoke a war between Andorians and Tellarites. This is an attempt
to destabilise the entire region. We need to find the marauder before
it attacks again. <br/>
T'POL: I've found a way to detect their warp signature. And Travis
designed a sensor grid that should extend our range. <br/>
ARCHER: How many ships will it take to make this work? <br/>
T'POL: Only one hundred and twenty eight. <br/>
ARCHER: There's just one way we can get that many ships to help us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SHRAN: Talas. <br/>
TALAS: Have you come to take me home? <br/>
SHRAN: I think this Denobulan doctor is secretly in love with you. He
wants to keep you to himself. <br/>
TALAS: You said my wound was superficial. <br/>
SHRAN: You were only grazed, but the phase pistol was set to kill. <br/>
TALAS: That Tellarite pig. <br/>
SHRAN: Is there any other kind? <br/>
TALAS: I've seen what phase-pulse infection can do to Andorians. <br/>
SHRAN: You're going to be fine. We'll be home soon, the two of us. <br/>
TALAS: Don't let me die unavenged. <br/>
SHRAN: I won't. <br/>
PHLOX: I'm sorry. She needs to rest. <br/>
SHRAN: See what I mean? He can't get enough of you. I'm jealous. <br/>
(He backs away from her bed, and Phlox draws the curtain so she can't
hear them.) <br/>
SHRAN: Doctor. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>
(Archer enters.) </font><br/>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARCHER:
How is she? <br/>
SHRAN: Lucky to be alive. <br/>
ARCHER: I have a proposal. <br/>
SHRAN: If it involves killing Tellarites, I'm all for it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Control area]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VRAX: (not in a military uniform) Your ship is
adrift in enemy space, damaged and defenceless, because of a single
Rigelian scoutship? Is that what you want me to report to the Senate? <br/>
VALDORE: The Drone has taken damage before. It's designed to
self-repair. <br/>
VRAX: If our enemies find it. <br/>
VALDORE: That's the point of this project. No prisoners to capture, no
bodies to recover. These Drone ships can never be traced back to us. <br/>
VRAX: This prototype's a modified warbird. The Vulcans would identify
it the moment they inspected the propulsion matrix. <br/>
VALDORE: The Vulcans won't get anywhere near it. <br/>
VRAX: Don't underestimate our distant brothers. Bring your ship home.
I'll tell the Senate that your test has been a success. Otherwise,
they'll make someone pay for this failure. <br/>
(He opens the door and we see two Remans waiting for the Senator.) <br/>
VRAX: And I promise you, it won't be me. Jolan tru, Admiral. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARCHER: Come in. <br/>
(T'Pol enters.) <br/>
ARCHER: Admiral Gardner just called. He's sending every ship available,
but at top speed it'll take weeks for most of them to get here. <br/>
T'POL: What about Columbia? <br/>
ARCHER: She's stuck in dry dock. Engine trouble. Did you get through to
your people? <br/>
T'POL: Minister T'Pau is dispatching twenty three vessels. <br/>
ARCHER: That's all? <br/>
T'POL: The High Command has been disbanded. Many of our ships no longer
have full crew compliments. <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pau could have picked a better time to clean house. <br/>
T'POL: (seeing his desk monitor) Andorian and Tellarite fleet
deployments? <br/>
ARCHER: I'm thinking of asking them to join us. Without more ships, our
sensor net's going to have a gaping hole. The marauder could fly right
through it, and we'd never know. <br/>
T'POL: Have you discussed this with Commander Shran, or Ambassador
Gral? <br/>
ARCHER: Not yet. <br/>
T'POL: Even if both sides were to agree, which seems unlikely, their
deployments would have to be co-ordinated, a command hierarchy
established. <br/>
ARCHER: An Andorian captain might have a problem taking orders from a
Tellarite? <br/>
T'POL: Precisely. <br/>
ARCHER: There's one species that's on friendly terms with both of them.
Humans. Enterprise could serve as the command ship, relaying all
orders. The other ships would only have to exchange communication
codes. <br/>
T'POL: It might work. <br/>
ARCHER: You don't sound too optimistic. <br/>
T'POL: These have four species have never co-operated on a mutual
endeavour. <br/>
ARCHER: As far as I know, no one's ever tried to get them together
before. From what I've heard about these Romulans, they mean business.
If they're behind these attacks, we have to find some way to stop them,
or next time, they might come back with a thousand of those ships. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REED: Some of these circuits are live, but I don't
know what they're for. <br/>
TUCKER: And I can't figure out what half this stuff is. <br/>
REED: What about the other half? <br/>
TUCKER: Well, I think I found an environmental system. <br/>
REED: That'd make sense. These consoles look like crew stations. <br/>
TUCKER: Here goes. <br/>
(He activates a circuit, and something comes to life.) <br/>
TUCKER: Well, how about that. In a few minutes, we'll have heat and
air. <br/>
REED: Do you think it's possible that there's no one else on board? <br/>
TUCKER: Why would a robot ship have a Bridge like this? <br/>
REED: It could be a prototype. Outfit an existing ship with the latest
in computer controls. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, that'd make things a whole lot easier for us. <br/>
REED: How's that? <br/>
TUCKER: If this ship's run by computer, what we need to do is find the
off switch. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SHRAN: I'd rather co-habit with Klingon targs than
join forces with Tellarites. <br/>
GRAL: Your personal mating preference is no concern of mine. <br/>
(The pair square up to each other across the table, and Archer waves
the MACOs away.) <br/>
ARCHER: If you're waiting for me to stop you, don't worry. I won't. <br/>
SHRAN: You heard what he said. <br/>
ARCHER: And I heard what you said. So now it's time for both of you to
listen to me. Instead of insulting you to make you feel at home, and
putting up with your arrogance as a sign of my respect, why don't the
two of you try behaving like humans for a change? <br/>
GRAL: And you said you wouldn't be insulting. <br/>
(The pair sit as Archer stands.) <br/>
ARCHER: There's one thing humans seem to do better than any species
we've met. When we're faced with a common threat, we put our
differences aside and try to co-operate. Someone is determined to start
a war in this region. I've shown you how we can stop them. But if you
don't understand that, feel free to strangle each other. Just remember,
that's exactly what this marauder wants you to do. </font></p>

REED: We've gone back to warp. <br/>
TUCKER: Just when it happened, I got a power spike from one of these
conduits. <br/>
REED: Do you think warp control runs through here? <br/>
TUCKER: If this ship was originally built for a crew, all of its
controls should connect to the Bridge. Maybe they never got
disconnected. Keep your eyes on these consoles. <br/>

REED: That's where we are. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm going to guess that's the power circuit I just shut down. <br/>

ARCHER: A few of them are a bit before my time, but they were all named
Enterprise. This one sailed Earth's oceans almost four hundred years
ago. <br/>
SHRAN: My vessel, the Kumari, was named for the first ice-cutter to
circumnavigate Andoria. Perhaps future ships will be named after our

SHRAN: It's her blood. When a Guardsman dies far from home, his
companions, her companions, carry part of her back to the ice of
Andoria. I wanted you to know that, too <br/>

drags him off.) <br/>

NAARG: Keep him away! <br/>
SHRAN: You will face justice at my hands! <br/>
ARCHER: That's not going to happen on my ship. <br/>
SHRAN: Yes, it will, pinkskin, because if you and the Tellarites don't
show respect for Andorian tradition, the Imperial Guard will withdraw
its ships. <br/>

T'POL: If you back down, the Imperial Guard will withdraw their ships. <br/>

will pull out anyway. The Tellarites'll do the same thing if Shran
kills one of them. So, I'm the only one who can be killed, because
Starfleet won't withdraw. This operation is important, considering that
it might lead to an alliance of planets. <br/>

TRAVIS: Look at this. Either combatant can postpone a duel indefinitely
if there are no children to continue his clan. <br/>
HOSHI: How does that help us? <br/>
TRAVIS: As far as I know, Captain Archer doesn't have any kids. If he's
killed, his clan would die with him. <br/>
HOSHI: That rule only applies if he's married. <br/>
TRAVIS: Don't suppose we can find him a wife in the next four hours. <br/>
HOSHI: Even if we could, something tells me the Andorians would cry
foul. There are twelve thousand amendments to this ridiculous honour
code. There has got to be one that can get him out of this. <br/>

find a way for the Captain to win. <br/>
