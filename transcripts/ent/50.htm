T'POL: It could be a phantom reading, background radiation. <br/>
ARCHER: Even your scientists have confirmed the existence of dark
matter. <br/>
T'POL: But never in such dense concentration. <br/>
ARCHER: That's the point. If it really is a dark matter nebula, we'd be
the first to directly observe one. <br/>
T'POL: Even with modified sensors there wouldn't be much to see. <br/>
ARCHER: I've heard of Vulcan experiments where they were able to excite
dark matter by bombarding it with metrion particles. <br/>
T'POL: Those tests involved very small quantities. This structure is
nearly ten million kilometres in diameter. <br/>
ARCHER: (to Tucker) Could you rig some kind of spatial charges?
Something that would spread the metrion particles over a wider area? <br/>
TUCKER: If I can, it should put on a hell of a show. <br/>
HOSHI: Sorry to interrupt, Captain. It's Admiral Forrest. <br/>

you'll know it. <br/>

regulations prohibit the Captain from leaving the ship unaccompanied. <br/>

T'POL: We should reach the edge of the phenomenon in two hours, forty
six minutes. I can pass the time by meditating, but if you'd prefer to
talk? <br/>
ARCHER: Go ahead and meditate. <br/>
T'POL: Would you like to join me? You seem quite unsettled since your
call from Admiral Forrest. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm fine. <br/>
T'POL: Commander Tucker was reluctant to discuss it as well, though he
did mention an old colleague had died. <br/>
ARCHER: A Starfleet Captain. A. G. Robinson. I wouldn't be out here if
it weren't for him. <br/>
T'POL: I'm somewhat familiar with Starfleet history. I've never heard
of a Captain Robinson. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sure there's a paragraph about him in the Vulcan data base.

burned the midnight oil in that simulator, eighteen, twenty hour days.
You shut everything and everyone out of your life just so you could be
the first. <br/>

with a little healthy competition. <br/>

command a starship. <br/>

ROBINSON: I'm not interested in your opinion, Lieutenant. <br/>

years to rein in this programme. You walked in there today, ruled out
pilot error, and told them just what they wanted to hear. Our engine
doesn't work. <br/>

work. <br/>

ARCHER: It's all right. Auxiliary's kicking in. <br/>
T'POL: There was a surge in the EPS grid. <br/>
ARCHER: We must be getting close. Trip said the dark matter might
affect the shuttle's systems. He'll be happy to hear he was right. <br/>
T'POL: It was probably nothing more than a simple malfunction. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't think so. Our pre-launch checks were all fine.
Something else caused that surge. <br/>
T'POL: I'm not detecting any dark matter. <br/>
ARCHER: Have a little faith, T'Pol. <br/>
T'POL: Even if you're right, it may be dangerous to proceed. Another
surge could disable life support. <br/>
ARCHER: One thing I learned from AG. You're never going to get anywhere
without taking risks. <br/>
T'POL: You obviously admired this man. <br/>
ARCHER: Quite a bit. <br/>
T'POL: And yet he cracked your molar. <br/>
ARCHER: Humans can have funny ways of forming friendships. <br/>
T'POL: To say the least. <br/>
ARCHER: He would have loved it out here. Too bad he never got the
chance. God knows he earned it. <br/>
T'POL: I thought you said he was responsible for nearly ending the
programme. <br/>
ARCHER: He was also responsible for getting it back on course, with a
little help from me and Trip. </font></p>

ARCHER: I've been thinking about what you were saying last night about
my father's engine. <br/>
ROBINSON: Look, I was out of line. <br/>
ARCHER: You were right. I wanted to see this thing fly so badly, it
kept me from being objective. <br/>
ROBINSON: That's good of you to admit, but it doesn't really matter
now. <br/>
ARCHER: It may. I got my hands on the telemetry from your flight. It
looks like Tucker was right about the intermix, but I think we can
compensate for it. <br/>
ROBINSON: You heard Forrest. The programme is on hold indefinitely. <br/>
ARCHER: We can take this to Starfleet, make a case to get off the
ground again. <br/>
ROBINSON: What about the Vulcans? They'll look at your data and say we
need to run computer simulations for another ten years to prove that
you're right. <br/>
ARCHER: Commodore Forrest will back us up. <br/>
ROBINSON: Forrest answers to Starfleet Command. It's out of his hands. <br/>
ARCHER: Even if his two senior pilots insist that this ship can fly? If
the three of us go in there together, we might be able to change their
minds. You just went faster than any human being ever has and now your
going to walk away? Let them put the ship in mothballs when we're so
close to breaking warp three? You're always talking about taking risks.
What have we got to lose? <br/>
ROBINSON: If you want to convince the Vulcans, you'll have to do a lot
better than showing them a bunch of antimatter calculations. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm open to suggestions. <br/>
ROBINSON: We only lost one ship. Still have one left. <br/>
ARCHER: They'll never give us clearance. <br/>
ROBINSON: Can you think of a better way to prove it'll fly? You want to
talk about taking risks? You're a great pilot, maybe as good as me, but
you're never going to get out into deep space by playing it safe. When
the first warp five starship is built, it's Captain won't be able to
call home every time he needs to make a decision. He won't be able to
turn to the Vulcans, unless he decides to take one with him. </font></p>

I've never read anything about two Starfleet pilots stealing the warp
three prototype. <br/>

advertise. Don't you believe me? <br/>

believe you had to be convinced to participate. <br/>

FORREST: I'm not done, Commander! You are both suspended from duty
pending an inquiry, and by the time Starfleet Command gets through with
you, you're going to wish that you had never come back. You're supposed
to represent the best that Starfleet has to offer. Keeping this
programme on track is hard enough without our own officers undermining
it. What did you think that this stunt of yours would accomplish? That
just because you didn't get yourselves killed that we'd ignore that
data we've collected, the testing we've done, the recommendations of
the Vulcan Advisory Council? <br/>
ROBINSON: If we follow all their recommendations, we'll never make it
into deep space. <br/>
VULCAN: No one is suggesting that your warp programme be dismantled,
only that Starfleet proceed with more restraint. <br/>
ROBINSON: Get Lieutenant Tucker in here. Ask any engineer on the
project. They'll tell you this ship can fly. Archer and I just proved
it. We're ready to go. Now. <br/>
VULCAN: That's not you decision to make. <br/>
ARCHER: With all due respect, its not your's either. You're right, sir.
We were reckless. We knew there'd be consequences. We knew we'd
probably be thrown out of Starfleet. <br/>
FORREST: You may have been right. <br/>
ARCHER: AG and I may never fly again, but its a small sacrifice to make
if it keeps this project going. We didn't build this engine to make
test runs around Jupiter. We built it to explore. If my father were
alive today, he'd be standing here asking, what the hell are we waiting
for? <br/>

they grounded us for three months. <br/>
T'POL: Still, the NX programme continued. <br/>
ARCHER: Eventually. The Vulcans had us run every simulation they could
think of for over a year before they finally admitted the engine would
