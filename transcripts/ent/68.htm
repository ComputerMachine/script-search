<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: Porthos, come back here. Porthos, stop.
Return. Heel, that's it. Heel. Porthos. <br/>
(Outside Archer's quarters, the faithful companion scratches at the
door and yips.) <br/>
PHLOX: All right, but just for a moment. </font></p>

and licks his face.) <br/>
PHLOX: That's enough. You can come and see him again tomorrow. <br/>
(Phlox picks Porthos up and leaves. Archer never even twitched.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Phlox's quarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: (reading) It says here that canines can be
quite territorial. Is that why you keep returning to the Captain's
quarters? On Earth, a dog called Scruffers travelled three thousand
kilometres attempting to reunite with it's human keeper. I heard of a
Pycan space moth that drifted half a light year trying to return to
it's home world, but I don't believe it had a name. I could use a walk.
How about you? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: (dictating) Dear Doctor Lucas. I apologise
in responding to your last letter. As you can imagine, the crew and I
have been quite busy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Galley]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: In we go. I
was deeply saddened to hear about your colleagues lost in the Xindi
attack. You have my condolences. It's unfortunate you were forced to
cut your time on Denobula short, but obviously you're needed on Earth.
Perhaps when our mission is successfully completed I'll see you back in
San Francisco. The Expanse. An extremely curious place. <br/>(He takes
something from a jar labeled Dr Phlox - do not eat.) <br/>PHLOX: For example, we've
recently encountered a phenomenon that, er. (to Porthos) Do you want
one of these? I doubt you'd like it. It's a leech, you know. It will
clean out your intestinal tract. Don't tell the Captain. <br/>(Porthos
catches the morsel.) <br/>PHLOX: I apparently find myself in somewhat unsettling
circumstances, Doctor Lucas. Although they have allowed me the luxury
of catching up on my correspondence. <br/>
(Phlox eats a leech himself.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Situation room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX [OC]: We first encountered the phenomenon
responsible for this situation two days ago. <br/>
T'POL: It's directly on our route to Azati Prime. <br/>
ARCHER: Why didn't sensors pick it up before now? <br/>
T'POL: Because it wasn't there before now. It's similar to the
phenomenon we encountered several weeks ago. <br/>
ARCHER: A trans-dimensional disturbance. <br/>
T'POL: This region is being rapidly reconfigured as we speak. <br/>
ARCHER: How long would it take to go around it? <br/>
T'POL: Two weeks. <br/>
REED: Another detour. <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps not. Since this region was formed only recently, it
hasn't been completely reconfigured. We should still be able to cross
it safely. <br/>
TUCKER: You said nothing from our universe could survive inside these
things. <br/>
T'POL: Doctor. <br/>
PHLOX: That's true, unless we take the appropriate precautions. The
reconfigured space disrupts the human neocortex, but I can counteract
the effects by dampening the crew's neurological activity. It would be
like, oh, shutting down the main computer to protect it from an ion
storm. <br/>
TUCKER: How do you plan to shut down our neocortexes? <br/>
PHLOX: Quite simply, I can place each of you in a comatose state until
we've passed through the affected region. <br/>
ARCHER: How quickly can we get across it? <br/>
T'POL: Less than an hour at warp four. <br/>
TUCKER: I don't want to risk going to warp in there. Who knows what
kind of effect this disturbance will have on our warp field. We'll be
safer sticking to impulse. You'll have to keep us in comas for at least
four days. <br/>
REED: That's still less time than it would take to go around it. <br/>
ARCHER: Can you keep us under that long? <br/>
PHLOX: Shouldn't cause any problems. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Travis's quarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: Commander Tucker was none too keen on my
plan. However, I was able to convince Captain Archer. Since my
Denobulan physiology is immune to the effects of the disturbance, I
volunteered to watch over the crew. So far, they've been no trouble at
all. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge - memory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Phlox is getting a practical driving lesson.) <br/>
PHLOX [OC]: While the computer's controlling most of the ship's
systems, I was given a quick tutorial, just in case. Despite the dire
circumstances I must say I relished the challenge and soon developed a
new-found respect for Ensign Mayweather. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Engineering - memory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TUCKER: You need to check this every two hours,
minimum. <br/>
PHLOX: Every two hours. <br/>
TUCKER: If the impulse manifolds get clogged, the engines'll overload.
That would be very bad. <br/>
PHLOX: I imagine it would. <br/>
TUCKER: No offence, Doc, but under normal circumstances I wouldn't even
let you in here without four years of Starfleet training under your
belt. <br/>
PHLOX: These are hardly normal circumstances. <br/>
TUCKER: Listen. If something happens, something you can't handle, I
want you to wake me up. <br/>
PHLOX: I can't do that. Even a few minutes of exposure would cause
permanent damage. <br/>
TUCKER: If it comes down to saving the ship? Look, I'm making it easy
for you. Okay? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Archer's quarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: How's the rest of the crew doing? <br/>
PHLOX: Sleeping peacefully, except for you. Now, lie back. <br/>
ARCHER: Doctor. <br/>
PHLOX: Please, Captain, I've told you the procedure's completely safe. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sure it is, but I <br/>
PHLOX: Captain, I have already had this discussion with Commander
Tucker, Lieutenant Reed and virtually every other officer on the ship.
I'm not comfortable being incapacitated, I really should be at my post,
I'm willing to risk staying awake. Well you can't, nor do you need to.
I assure you I have everything well in hand. <br/>
ARCHER: I know, Doctor. As Captain of the ship I'm the one who's
responsible for everyone aboard. There aren't many people I'd willingly
turn that responsibility over to. You're one of them. <br/>
PHLOX: Well, thank you, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: I just wanted to say that before you put me under. <br/>
(Archer lies down on his bed, and Phlox does the deed.) <br/>
PHLOX [OC]: I must say, Doctor Lucas, that I appreciated the Captain's
vote of confidence. I had in fact been feeling some trepidation over
the responsibility I'd been handed, but after two days at the helm the
ship is running perfectly. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (He hears a door slamming somewhere.) <br/>
PHLOX: Hello? Hello? (finds no one) Nonetheless, I'm not ashamed to
admit I'll be relieved when I can wake up the crew in two days, sixteen
hours and forty three minutes. </font></p>

JEAN: The chalice from the palace. <br/>
WITCH: It's a little crystal chalice with a figure of a palace. <br/>
HAWKINS: The chalice from the palace have the pellet with the poison?<br/>
WITCH: No, the pellet with the poison's in the vessel with a pestle.<br/>
HAWKINS: Oh, oh, the pestle with the vessel. <br/>
JEAN: The vessel with a pestle. <br/>
HAWKINS: What about the palace from the chalice?<br/>
WITCH: Not the palace from the chalice! The chalice from the palace! <br/>
HAWKINS: Where's the pellet with the poison? <br/>
WITCH: In the vessel with a pestle!<br/>

PHLOX: (to Porthos, his faithful companion) Did you hear that? <br/>
WITCH: Just remember that. <br/>
MAN: Sir Giacomo, into your armour, and you to your place in the
pavilion. <br/>
HAWKINS: The pellet with the poison, the pellet with the poison.<br/>
PHLOX: Computer, mute sound. (I have no idea what he hears) That
doesn't sound normal, does it. I suppose we should investigate, hmm.
I'm not going alone. Come, Porthos, come. (picks him up) I'd be better
off talking to my Pyrithian bat. </font></p>

Porthos! Porthos, come back here. Porthos. <br/>

PHLOX: Well, now don't you feel foolish. <br/>
(A door closes, and he turns to see - and clutches at his heart.) <br/>
PHLOX: I called out. Didn't you hear me? <br/>
T'POL: I was running a diagnostic. Do you require my assistance? What
are you doing here? I thought it was movie night. <br/>
PHLOX: You could hear that all the way from the mess hall. <br/>
T'POL: I'll make a note of it in the maintenance log. <br/>
PHLOX: Bangs, squeaks, rattling chains. <br/>(He turns off the venting steam.)
<br/>PHLOX: Is this a starship or a haunted house? <br/>
T'POL: Are you all right, Doctor? You seem somewhat agitated. <br/>
PHLOX: Considering you nearly sent me into cardiac shock. <br/>
T'POL: I apologise if I startled you. You're certain that's all? <br/>
PHLOX: I have had a slight headache since we entered this region.
Perhaps Vulcans and Earth canines are better able to adapt to it than
Denobulans. How are you? I've barely seen you the last two days. <br/>
T'POL: I've had my duties to attend to. The rest of the time I've spent
in my quarters, reading, meditating. <br/>
PHLOX: Then you're due for a night out. Why don't you join Porthos and
me? <br/>

T'POL [OC]: Go ahead. <br/>
PHLOX: Would you mind not creeping around the ship like a Draxxan cloud
viper. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: Doctor? <br/>
PHLOX: Please. I wouldn't have imagined that Vulcans engaged in
childish games. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: I don't understand. <br/>

galley. Mess hall seems a bit, er, oh, melancholy. All the empty
chairs. <br/>
T'POL: This is fine. <br/>
PHLOX: My fifth grandmother made this for each of my weddings (ladling
liquid). Chef's tried to prepare it, but he never gets it quite right. <br/>
T'POL: Yes, his plomeek broth leaves something to be desired as well. <br/>
PHLOX: I always thought so, but was afraid to mention it. T'Pol, you're
sure you weren't in Engineering today? <br/>
T'POL: Quite sure. What were you doing there? I'm responsible for
monitoring the engines. <br/>
PHLOX: We're supposed to be assisting each other. It's a large ship for
two people to maintain. <br/>
T'POL: Do you have anything to report? Doctor? <br/>
PHLOX: I could have sworn there was someone in that room with me. <br/>
T'POL: A member of the crew? <br/>
PHLOX: No, everyone except us is in deep neuro-sedation. <br/>
T'POL: Then obviously you were mistaken. <br/>
PHLOX: Obviously. You've never been to Denobula, have you. <br/>
T'POL: No. <br/>
PHLOX: The cities are quite crowded, by choice, not by necessity. The
atmosphere is vibrant, communal. <br/>
T'POL: It sounds fascinating. <br/>
PHLOX: What I'm saying is that we're a sociable people. Being alone on
Enterprise, just the two of us, has proven more stressful than I
imagined. Two people aren't even enough for a Denobulan marriage, a
proper one anyway. <br/>
T'POL: I'm sorry I haven't been better company. <br/>
PHLOX: That isn't what I meant. <br/>
T'POL: I know. It is ironic, however, that I should be your sole
companion. Unlike your people, most Vulcans will go to great lengths to
find solitude. At times it has been trying for me to co-exist with
eighty humans. Especially the more irrational ones. <br/>
PHLOX: Such as Commander Tucker. <br/>
T'POL: I've found the last two days to be a welcome respite. <br/>
PHLOX: I understand, but I for one will never complain again when I
can't get a good seat on movie night. <br/>

circumstances surrounding your homecoming, Doctor Lucas, you must be
happy to return to Earth. As I've mentioned before, I've no regrets
about accepting my position on Enterprise. However, it has struck me
recently how much I miss the familiar pleasures of my home. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: You've experienced the nightclubs in our
Kaybin district, so you know the excitement of meeting a new companion
or two. The intimacy that can develop so quickly when all parties are
receptive. You humans are a truly remarkable species, Doctor Lucas, but
when Enterprise has accomplished its mission I look forward to being
among Denobulans again. The more of them, the better. </font></p>

T'POL: You can see for yourself there's nothing there. <br/>
PHLOX: You said this reconfigured space could be affecting our systems.
What if it's interfering with our sensors? <br/>
T'POL: That's possible, but we should consider another explanation. You
mentioned you were having difficulty adjusting to the solitude of the
past few days. <br/>
PHLOX: I didn't imagine it! I saw something. <br/>
T'POL: Outside the ship, crawling on the hull. <br/>
PHLOX: What about what I saw in Engineering? <br/>
T'POL: You ran the scans yourself. There is nothing unusual on board.

T'POL: If that's true, then how did they get on the ship? All external
hatches and docking ports are sealed. <br/>
PHLOX: They could have transporter technology. <br/>
T'POL: There were no transporter signatures. <br/>

assistance in that area. <br/>

two hours I wasted searching for a figment of your imagination? <br/>
PHLOX: I'm not delusional. <br/>
T'POL: Are you certain? As I recall, you once told Ensign Sato that
it's considered healthy for Denobulans to hallucinate. It's how you
release stress. You've been under a lot of stress lately, haven't you,

from you. <br/>
PHLOX: You're not real. <br/>
ARCHER: Why don't you go to your quarters. Lie down. I'll take over.
You did the best you could. <br/>
PHLOX: You are not real! <br/>
T'POL: Doctor. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: I was so busy monitoring the crew I never
thought to run another neural scan on myself. The effects are subtle
and difficult to detect, but there are disruptions deep within my
neocortex. You were right. I was hallucinating. <br/>
T'POL: Are you in danger? <br/>
PHLOX: I don't believe there'll be any permanent damage. However, it's
obviously affecting my judgment. I have no choice but to put myself
under neuro-sedation and ask you to look after the crew. <br/>
T'POL: I don't have the medical expertise. <br/>
PHLOX: With your scientific background, you should have no problems. <br/>
T'POL: I have my own duties. I can't possibly monitor the entire crew. <br/>
PHLOX: It won't be for long. We'll be coming out of the disturbance in
less than six hours. T'Pol, I'm asking for your help. <br/>
T'POL: I can't. <br/>
PHLOX: Why not? <br/>
T'POL: When we were searching the ship, I became irritated with you. <br/>
PHLOX: Apparently, I deserved it. <br/>
T'POL: You don't understand. I was on the verge of losing control of my
emotions. This reconfigured space is effecting me as well. <br/>
PHLOX: Why didn't you tell me? <br/>
T'POL: I'd hoped to control it, but it's proven more difficult than I
thought. The crew is better off in your hands. <br/>
PHLOX: I doubt that. I nearly killed Porthos, remember. What if one of
these delusions causes me to open an airlock or shut down life support?
<br/>
T'POL: You won't do that. <br/>
PHLOX: How do you know? <br/>
T'POL: Because your duty is to look out for the welfare of this crew.
Why do you think the Captain allowed you to sedate him over Commander
Tucker's objections? Because he trusts you, as do I. <br/>
PHLOX: I'm not sure I trust myself. <br/>
T'POL: Just a few more hours, Doctor. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX [OC]: So, Doctor Lucas, while the past few
days have proven challenging, both T'Pol and I are relieved that our
adventure is nearly over. <br/>
PHLOX: (taking the helm) Once we've confirmed we're out of the
disturbance I can begin waking the senior officers. My medical staff
should be next. They can assist me with the rest of the<br/>(He gazes in
disbelief at a purple viewscreen.) <br/>PHLOX: We should have been out of the
disturbance half an hour ago.<br/>
T'POL: There could have been some slight navigational discrepancies. <br/>
PHLOX: I thought space travel was supposed to be precise. <br/>
T'POL: Not always. Check long range sensors. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Phlox dashes to the back of the Situation room.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHLOX: What do you think
I'm doing. There's more than a slight discrepancy. <br/>
T'POL: This can't be correct. We're nearly a quarter of a light year
from the far edge. <br/>
PHLOX: At our current rate of speed we won't be out of this for another
ten weeks! Autonavigation is still engaged, engines are online, why
aren't we through? <br/>
T'POL: The reconfigured space has expanded. <br/>
PHLOX: But we knew it would. Travis said our course and speed would
compensate. T'Pol? <br/>
T'POL: Obviously the rate of acceleration has accelerated. We need to
increase speed. <br/>
PHLOX: We're already at full impulse. <br/>
T'POL: As you can see, that's insufficient. We need to go to warp. <br/>
PHLOX: Commander Tucker said it would be too dangerous. We don't know
what might happen. <br/>
T'POL: What do you propose? Keeping the crew comatose for the next ten
weeks? <br/>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: All right, what do we do first? <br/>
T'POL: I'm afraid I may not be of much assistance. <br/>
PHLOX: Do I need to keep reminding you, you are the Science Officer. <br/>
T'POL: I already told you, I'm finding it difficult to focus. <br/>
PHLOX: On your worst day you're more qualified to operate the warp
engines than I am. <br/>
T'POL: Unfortunately, this is by far one of my worst days. <br/>
PHLOX: I'm a physician, not an engineer. <br/>
T'POL: You hold a dozen scientific degrees. <br/>
PHLOX: None of them are in warp theory. <br/>
T'POL: The procedures for restarting the reactor are in the database. <br/>
PHLOX: You're suggesting I read the manual? (but he does, from a
screen) Output must be confined to within three hundred and three
hundred twelve millicochranes to prevent fusion of the dilithium
matrix. <br/>
T'POL: That seems simple enough. <br/>
PHLOX: Unless the spatial compression index is greater than five point
six two percent, or the ship is within two parsecs of a class C
gravimetric field distortion? <br/>
T'POL: I realise this is a complex procedure. <br/>
PHLOX: Complex? This is utterly baffling. It might as well be written
ancient Klingon for all the sense I can make of it. I'm sorry. <br/>
T'POL: I understand. I just wish I could be more helpful. <br/>
PHLOX: You're doing fine. We have to close the plasma relays before we
can begin the start-up sequence. Would you mind? <br/>
TUCKER: What the hell are you doing? I told you not to mess with the
warp engines. <br/>
PHLOX: I don't have time for this. <br/>
TUCKER: You'd better make time, Doc. I told you, you can't start the
warp reactor inside this disturbance. <br/>
PHLOX: Actually you told me it would be difficult, not impossible. <br/>
TUCKER: That machine was designed to manipulate space, to violate the
laws of motion. You make the tiniest mistake, you'll collapse the warp
field, you'll crush this ship. <br/>
PHLOX: Thank you for the warning. <br/>
TUCKER: You're going to screw this up, Phlox! <br/>
PHLOX: Go away. <br/>
TUCKER: You're going to kill everybody. <br/>
PHLOX: Can't you see I'm busy! <br/>
T'POL: Doctor, are you all right? <br/>
PHLOX: Fine. <br/>
T'POL: Doctor, I can't find the plasma relays. <br/>
PHLOX: I'll do it myself. <br/>(He goes to the main reactor controls.) <br/>PHLOX: Deuterium
pressure is nominal. Anti-matter constrictor coils are online. Warp two
should be sufficient. <br/>
T'POL: Shall we try? <br/>
(Bits of engine room start to light up.) <br/>
PHLOX: The intermix is stable. A warp field is forming. <br/>
(An alarm sounds.) <br/>
T'POL: What's wrong? <br/>
PHLOX: I don't know. <br/>(The ship shakes and the nacelles stutter.) <br/>PHLOX: I
followed the procedures exactly. What did I do wrong? <br/>
T'POL: You need to <br/>
PHLOX: What? What, T'Pol? Help me. Is it the particle confinement? <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps you should increase it. <br/>
PHLOX: How do I do that? <br/>(He dashes to his help screen.) <br/>PHLOX: Particle
confinement, particle confinement. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Things go bang.)</font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
T'POL: Doctor, perhaps we should wake Commander
Tucker. <br/>
PHLOX: He'll die. <br/>
T'POL: If we destroy the ship, we'll all die. <br/>
PHLOX: I know. <br/>
T'POL: If we can't accomplish our mission, billions of people on Earth
could die. Isn't it logical to sacrifice one life to save so many? <br/>
PHLOX: I'm not willing to make that sacrifice yet. Particle
confinement. Increase power to the magnetic constriction coils. <br/>(She
can't touch the controls, and looks plaintively at him.) <br/>PHLOX: T'Pol! Here.
<br/>(He does it himself and the shaking stops.) <br/>
T'POL: The field is stabilising. <br/>
PHLOX: It's holding. <br/>
T'POL: Then I suggest we go to warp. <br/>
PHLOX: Engaging warp engines. Warp one point one, point two. <br/>(The
engine gets unhappy again.) <br/>PHLOX: Pressure on the hull's increasing. <br/>
T'POL: What are you doing? <br/>
PHLOX: Lieutenant Reed insisted on showing me how to transfer power to
the hull plating, just in case. It seems to be working. Warp one point
eight, one point nine, warp two! </font></p>

PHLOX: Lie still. Your neocortex may need a few moments to warm up. <br/>
ARCHER: Are we through the disturbance? <br/>
PHLOX: Yes. I'll begin waking the rest of the crew shortly. <br/>
ARCHER: Any problems? <br/>
PHLOX: A few minor glitches. It will all be in my log. If you're

T'POL: Of course. Commander Tucker was complaining that it will take
him days to realign the warp coils. <br/>
