SOONG: No one was to be killed without my express order! <br/>

have half a dozen patrols in the area. <br/>
ARCHER: Is there something we can do to keep us from showing up on
their sensors? <br/>
TUCKER: I could paint a bird-of-prey on the hull. <br/>
REED: Perhaps we could fake a Klingon warp signature. <br/>
TUCKER: I'd have to reconfigure the coil assembly. It would take a few
hours, but it should be doable. <br/>
ARCHER: What's the status of C-12? <br/>
T'POL: Doctor Lucas and his team would like to return and begin
decontamination procedures. <br/>
TUCKER: That's quite a mess they've got to clean up. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOONG: Once we're safely through Klingon space,
we'll set a course for these coordinates. The Klingons call it Klach
D'kel Brakt. I call it the Briar Patch. It's a little catchier, don't
you think? <br/>
LOKESH: Briar Patch? <br/>
SOONG: You should have read more of the books I left for you. The
region is flooded with radiation from supernova remnants. The Klingons
have never mapped it. There are signs of at least two habitable planets
inside the Briar Patch. It's unlikely anyone will find us. <br/>
MALIK: This is your plan? To hide again? <br/>
SOONG: The embryos need to mature in a safe environment. <br/>
MALIK: Starfleet isn't going to give up so easily. They'll send other
ships. This gas cloud won't protect us. <br/>
SOONG: All right. What course would you set? <br/>
MALIK: I'm not certain. But I know that running away isn't the answer.
Are you familiar with the name Botany Bay? <br/>
PERSIS: It's a penal colony on the shores of Australia. <br/>
MALIK: It's also the name of a pre-warp vessel launched at the end of
the Great Wars. The ship carried many of our brethren, including Khan
Noonien Singh. <br/>
SOONG: Botany Bay is a myth. There's no evidence it ever existed. <br/>
MALIK: All records of the launch were destroyed. They didn't want to be
followed. <br/>
SOONG: Even if you're right, the ship was lost, never to be heard from
again. <br/>
MALIK: That's exactly my point. Khan was a great leader, but he made
one fatal mistake. He ran from his enemies rather than face them. We've
spent our entire lives running and hiding. When are we going to make a
stand? <br/>
SOONG: The matter is not open for debate. Alter our heading. Set a
course one eight four mark three. We're going to the Briar Patch. I'll
be in my lab. </font></p>

MALIK: Can't a son disagree with his father? I thought we were family. <br/>
SOONG: I'm willing to overlook the things you've done. But you have to
trust that what I'm doing is best for all of us. You used to have faith
in me. <br/>

SOONG: I know it wasn't easy after I left. <br/>
MALIK: How are the embryos? <br/>
SOONG: I'll be ready to incubate the first of them in a few hours. <br/>
MALIK: You're manipulating its DNA. <br/>
SOONG: These base-pairs sequences regulate the neurotransmitter levels
in their brain. If I can modify them, aggression and violent behaviour
will be removed. <br/>
MALIK: You're changing its personality. <br/>
SOONG: I'm correcting a defect in its genome. Genetic engineering was
in its infancy when you were created. They weren't able to repair all
the mistakes. <br/>

SOONG: I didn't know how until recently. <br/>

SOONG: A single torpedo would never make it through their hull plating.

MALIK: I wasn't talking about the Enterprise. We use it against the
Klingons. The Qu'Vat colony is less than four light-years away. If we
detonate the torpedo inside the upper atmosphere, it'll scatter the
pathogen across the entire planet. Every organism on the surface will
be dead within days. When the High Council hears that humans have
decimated their colony, they'll launch a counterstrike. The Klingons
will keep Starfleet busy for years. <br/>

KLINGON [OC]: Who is this? <br/>
ARCHER: My name isn't your concern. <br/>
KLINGON [OC]: You've entered restricted space. Drop out of warp and
prepare for inspection. <br/>
ARCHER: The last time I checked this was still Klingon territory. <br/>
KLINGON [OC]: No ship is allowed to pass through this system without
authorisation, on the orders of Governor Klag. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't take orders from a mere governor. We're on important
business for the High Council. <br/>
KLINGON [OC]: What sort of business? <br/>
ARCHER: That matter is classified. <br/>
KLINGON [OC]: I'm not detecting a Council transponder signal. Perhaps
you forgot to activate it. <br/>
ARCHER: You expect me to turn on a transponder and let every ship in
the area know that we have the Chancellor on board? <br/>
KLINGON [OC]: Chancellor M'Rek is on your ship? <br/>
ARCHER: He had important negotiations with the Orions. We're taking him
back to Kronos. <br/>
KLINGON [OC]: The Orions. (laughs) I've heard rumours of his
negotiations with their females. Tell me, is it true what they say
about them? <br/>
ARCHER: If I were you, I wouldn't be making allegations about
Chancellor M'Rek over an unsecure channel. <br/>
KLINGON [OC]: I meant no insult. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sure you didn't. It would be best if you made no mention of
this to your superiors, or you might find yourself commanding a garbage
scow. <br/>
KLINGON [OC]: Understood. We're honoured to have the Chancellor in our
system. Qapla'. <br/>

colony. <br/>
ARCHER: What were you doing in that escape pod? <br/>
SOONG: What do you think? I was waiting for you. You're the only one
who can stop them! I didn't come back because I missed our lively
debates. Please, please, you have to do as I ask. <br/>
ARCHER: Your story doesn't sound very plausible. I think we were
getting close to finding your Augments. You may have put yourself into
that escape pod to throw us off. <br/>
SOONG: You're not serious. <br/>
ARCHER: You've made it clear you'll do anything for them. Lie, murder,

Incident look like a lovers' quarrel.
ARCHER: What do you care what happens to Earth? You believe your
children are the future of humanity. <br/>
SOONG: Captain. Captain, contact C-12! Three hundred kilograms of
biotoxins are missing from their inventory. <br/>
ARCHER: Doctor Lucas already told me about the missing toxins. <br/>
SOONG: Malik stole them without my knowledge. He's going to use them on
the colony. You saw what he did on the station. You know what he's
capable of. <br/>
ARCHER: You didn't know? You had to see him murder someone in front of
you. <br/>
SOONG: What do you want me to say? That you were right about them, and
I was wrong? Maybe things would have been different if I'd been there
for them, if Starfleet hadn't locked me away. <br/>
ARCHER: None of that would have mattered in the end. It's in their
nature. They were engineered to be this way. Superior ability breeds
superior ambition. One of their creators wrote that. He was murdered by
an Augment. </font></p>

to push the engines pretty hard to get there in time. <br/>

wasn't damaged in the attack. Someone took it offline to cover his
escape. <br/>
PERSIS: Maybe he disabled it. <br/>

the Klingons. <br/>

only ones who weren't on the Bridge when Soong escaped. <br/>
