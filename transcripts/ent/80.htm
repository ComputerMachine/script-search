neatly arranged on the walls, and in huge piles on the floor. A
familiar looking man in overalls is sitting at a table, writing. In
this

VOICE [OC]: You have a visitor. <br/>
SOONG: I'm busy. <br/>
VOICE [OC}: Stand up, Doctor. <br/>(Muttering under his breath, he puts down
his pencil and does so.) <br/>VOICE [OC]: Arms. <br/>
(The metal devices on his wrists lock themselves together to form a
chunky pair of handcuffs. The door opens.) <br/>
SOONG: Jonathan Archer. What brings you here? They're naming the prison
after you? <br/>
ARCHER: I need to ask you some questions. <br/>
SOONG: I'm kind of in the middle of something. <br/>
ARCHER: It won't take long. <br/>
SOONG: Well. I suppose it's not every day one gets to speak to the man
who saved the planet. Please. (Archer steps into the cell) I apologise
for the clutter. I'm not allowed traditional recording devices. <br/>
(The guard closes the door and steps out of sight.) <br/>
ARCHER: You programmed a PADD to unlock every security door in the
building. <br/>
SOONG: I was particularly proud of that. I made it all the way to
Sausalito. On the rare occasion I get stuck on a problem, I find a
vigorous escape attempt helps to clear the head. (Archer looks at a
paper) Go ahead. They're DNA sequences. That one is for a modification
of the human T-cell. It would render Sharat Syndrome a thing of the
past. That one increases the visual spectrum by five percent. Of
course, none of this will ever be tested. They clear out my room every
few months. I'm told it all gets vaporised. <br/>
ARCHER: Why invest so much time and energy on things no one will ever
use? <br/>
SOONG: How can a supposedly intelligent species reject technology that
would enhance ability, relieve suffering? <br/>
ARCHER: Genetic engineering has caused a lot of suffering. <br/>
SOONG: So did splitting the atom, yet the first ships to colonise the
solar system were nuclear-powered. But you're not here to discuss that.
<br/>
ARCHER: Someone attacked a Klingon Bird of Prey. The entire crew was
massacred. The ship is missing. <br/>
SOONG: I read the reports. I understand the Klingons are quite annoyed.
Looks like you might've saved Earth for nothing. <br/>
ARCHER: Whoever's responsible jettisoned the Klingon crew into space.
DNA was recovered from the bodies. <br/>
SOONG: Let me guess. Human? <br/>
ARCHER: Not quite. <br/>
SOONG: I see. <br/>
ARCHER: They were Augments. Their genetically-enhanced DNA matched
embryos stolen from a medical facility over twenty years ago. Stolen by
you. </font></p>

ARCHER: Soong used to work at Cold Station 12, a top secret medical
research station. <br/>
REED: Isn't that where Starfleet keeps a stockpile of infectious
diseases? <br/>
ARCHER: Along with genetically-engineered embryos left over from the
Eugenics Wars. It's been kept from the public for obvious reasons.
<br/>TRAVIS: I remember Soong's trial. He wouldn't say what he did with the
embryos he stole. <br/>
ARCHER: Now he now claims that he took them to a planet in the Trialus
System and raised them. They were around ten years old when he was
captured, a decade ago. <br/>
TUCKER: So there could be a bunch of Augments from the Eugenics Wars
running around loose. <br/>
TRAVIS: Not a pretty thought. <br/>
REED: What would they want with a Klingon Bird of Prey? <br/>
ARCHER: We don't know. Neither does Soong. At least he claims he
doesn't. But he does think he can convince them to surrender without a
fight. <br/>
REED: You're bringing him along. <br/>
ARCHER: There's also the fact that he spent time in the Borderland. <br/>
HOSHI: The Borderland? <br/>
REED: The area where the Klingon ship was attacked. <br/>
T'POL: It's a volatile region between the Klingon Empire and the Orion
Syndicate. It attracts the most dangerous elements from both. <br/>
HOSHI: Sorry I asked. <br/>
ARCHER: The Klingons have threatened to retaliate with everything
they've got. We're the fastest ship and the most experienced crew. We
have to find the Augments and bring them back. It's the only way to
avert a war. We launch in six hours. </font></p>

PERSIS: We're finally free. <br/>
RAAKIN: A fine ship. <br/>
(Suddenly he hits Malik.) <br/>
MALIK: I thought you'd be pleased. <br/>
RAAKIN: I didn't sanction this attack. If you'd failed, they would've
come after all of us. <br/>
MALIK: I didn't fail. <br/>
RAAKIN: Their government knows what we did. They have ships hunting for
us right now. <br/>
MALIK: They won't find us. It was time for us to leave this godforsaken

ARCHER: This is my Science Officer, T'Pol. <br/>
SOONG: No need for an introduction. I admire your people very much. We
share a similar view of humanity. <br/>
T'POL: What view is that? <br/>
SOONG: That it could stand some improvement. <br/>
T'POL: I believe that's true of most species, if not all. <br/>
ARCHER: My Tactical Officer, Lieutenant Reed. <br/>
REED: Doctor. <br/>
SOONG: I've heard of you, but I don't recognise your face. You're not
getting your fair share of publicity. <br/>
REED: I think I've had all I can stand. <br/>
ARCHER: We've prepared some quarters. You'll be under guard at all
times. If you should decide you need to clear your head. <br/>
SOONG: We're on a starship soon to be at high warp. Where exactly would
I go? <br/>
ARCHER: It's this way. <br/>
(The group head off down a corridor.) <br/>
SOONG: If I could examine the DNA samples the Klingons recovered, I
could tell you something about the current state of the Augments. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll have the information sent to your quarters. <br/>
SOONG: A laboratory would be preferable, your Sickbay. Doctor Phlox's
reputation rivals my own, before I was imprisoned, of course. I'd enjoy
trading notes with him. <br/>

toward this field of medicine. <br/>
PHLOX: On the contrary, we've used genetic engineering on Denobula for
over two centuries, to generally positive effect. <br/>
SOONG: But you don't approve of what I've done. <br/>
PHLOX: You tried to redesign your species. The first time that was

Phlox tries to remove it.) <br/>
ARCHER: They normally remove the restraint after a sale. We used the
extra tritanium to bribe one of the guards to deactivate it but leave
it on him. <br/>
TUCKER: Why can't we just buy the rest of our people? <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pol's already been sold. We don't have time to try and buy
them all. <br/>
PHLOX: We're almost there. Try to hold still. <br/>
TUCKER: What kind of people are these? <br/>
SOONG: I'd say they're not unlike some of your ancestors, judging from
your accent. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, if I remember my history, these Augments you love so much
had plenty of slaves. <br/>
SOONG: They were more like subjects. <br/>
TUCKER: Oh. They were just treated like slaves. <br/>
(Phlox removes the restraint from Pierce's neck, and Archer hands it to
Tucker.) <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pol could be shipped out any second. Work fast. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A clandestine meeting is taking place.) <br/>
PERSIS: I told him everything. He thinks you're planning an attack
against him. <br/>
MALIK: Is he going to move against me? <br/>
RAAKIN: (with a disruptor rifle) See for yourself. Is this the move you
expected? <br/>(Malik looks at Persis.) <br/>RAAKIN: It's between us. I saved your life
once when we were children, pulled you from the river when you fell in.
<br/>
MALIK: I remember. <br/>
RAAKIN: Now, ten years later, you're plotting against me. <br/>
MALIK: I'm the strongest and the smartest. <br/>
RAAKIN: Doesn't look that way from here. You would never have trapped
me like this. <br/>
(But the gun doesn't fire when he pulls the trigger.) <br/>
MALIK: But I have. <br/>
(Malik's supporters arrive.) <br/>
PERSIS: I'm sorry, Raakin. <br/>
MALIK: It's between us. <br/>
RAAKIN: Saul, Jaya, listen to me. <br/>
MALIK: They only listen to me now. There was a time when I looked up to
you, when I called you my brother. <br/>
RAAKIN: I am your brother. <br/>
MALIK: When you rejected our father's wishes, you stopped being one of
us, and when that happened, you ceased to exist. <br/>(He stabs Raakin in
the stomach.) <br/>MALIK: Which makes this an act of mercy. Get rid of him. <br/>(Persis
is starting to cry.) <br/>MALIK: Don't. Not for him. </font></p>

TUCKER [OC]: We're sending the code now. <br/>
ARCHER: Got it. <br/>
(He distracts a guard so Soong can inject him with something. It takes
a few sways, but the giant finally topples onto his back. They're seen
by someone though, as Soong goes to the control panels and starts
working with the code. In the main market, the Slaver and her Tellarite purchaser comes for
T'Pol.) <br/>
SLAVER: Outside. Outside! <br/>
(The alien who spotted them tells another guard, but inside, T'Pol has
felt her restraint switch off, so she hits the Tellarite and all the
prisoners see the Slaver's control fail to bring her to her knees in
agony.) <br/>
PRISONER: The restraints are off! <br/>
(They make a break for it.) <br/>
SLAVER: Slaves are loose! Slaves are loose! <br/>
(The alarms go off, slaves get out of the cages and run for it. Some
encounter Orions with pain sticks.) <br/>
ARCHER: Trip, start beaming them, five at a time. <br/>

ARCHER: You knew exactly where the Orions were operating. You knew
they'd abduct members of my crew. Maybe you were even hoping they'd get
you. <br/>
SOONG: There was an outside chance. <br/>
ARCHER: You were determined to escape, no matter who got hurt. <br/>
SOONG: No one was injured. <br/>
ARCHER: Nine of my people were nearly sold into slavery. Two of them
may have permanent physical damage because of the restraints. <br/>
SOONG: I didn't take this action lightly. <br/>
ARCHER: Is that supposed to justify what you did? <br/>
SOONG: I'm simply saying it wasn't easy for me to place you and your
crew in jeopardy. I respect you, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: Then tell me how to find the Augments. You know where they're
going. <br/>
SOONG: They didn't steal a Klingon ship to go sightseeing.<br/>
ARCHER: They're dangerous. <br/>
SOONG: They're the future. They're stronger, smarter, free from
sickness, with life spans twice as long as our own. You, more than
anyone, should appreciate what this means. <br/>
ARCHER: Why me? <br/>
SOONG: Your father suffered from Clarke's Disease. His final years were
marked with extreme pain. <br/>
ARCHER: My father has nothing to do with this. <br/>
SOONG: He didn't need to suffer. Genetic engineering could've cured
him. Those who want to suppress my Augments are the same ones who
condemned your father to death. Turn the ship around, Captain. Go home.
Leave them alone. <br/>

TUCKER: I'm glad they got that thing off with no problem. <br/>
T'POL: There's a slight ringing in my left ear, but it should dissipate
over time. <br/>
TUCKER: Good. Well, I'll let you get back to that. <br/>
T'POL: Vulcans don't have honeymoons. After the ceremony, I went to
Mount Seleya to meditate alone. <br/>

MALIK: Earth considers my father a criminal. Why? Because he brought us
to life. You want to take us back to a world that opposes our very
existence. <br/>

MALIK: That's not our problem. We don't care what happens to you.
Humanity is no longer relevant. To quote one of your philosophers,
Nietzsche, mankind is something to be surpassed. <br/>
