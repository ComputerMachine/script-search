<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REED:
You're really starting to get a feel for the game. <br/>
TRAVIS: Thirty two pieces, sixty four squares. It's not as if it's
difficult. The total number of possible outcomes is limited. <br/>
REED: Ten to the one hundred twenty third power. <br/>
TRAVIS: That's what I mean. Chess is so predictable, I'm surprised
anyone bothers to play it. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>

Their average life span's only about a hundred years. With no time to
play all the possible games. <br/>
TRAVIS: What a waste. <br/>
REED: Careful. No emotional involvement. <br/>
TRAVIS: I know the rules. Observation without interference. <br/>
(Another speed-chess game finishes already.) <br/>
TRAVIS: You'll win in five moves. <br/>
REED: I'm the ship's champion. I win all the tournaments. <br/>
TRAVIS: How do you think they'll react to what's on this planet? <br/>
REED: Well, that's what we're here to find out, but in my experience,
all physical species are alike. I don't expect humans will be any
different. <br/>
TRAVIS: Do you think our hosts will die tonight? <br/>
REED: It's possible. For some of the species that have come here, I've
seen the whole crew die. For others, only a few. <br/>
TRAVIS: But somebody always dies. <br/>
REED: Always. <br/>

TUCKER: Two days ago, you couldn't wait to get off the ship. <br/>
HOSHI: Sifting through a Klingon garbage dump. Not my idea of exploring
strange new worlds. <br/>

dirt. Shuttlepod One to Enterprise. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Welcome back. How did your treasure hunt turn out? <br/>
TUCKER: Well, nothing worth bringing home. The Klingons must've been
here years ago. All they left was an old power cell and a bunch of
empty ration packs. <br/>

TUCKER: Like I've been gut-punched by a Tellarite. <br/>
HOSHI: Doctor, should we start with the bio-gel? <br/>
PHLOX: Not until we know what we're dealing with. Three other landing
parties returned from the surface with no ill effects. <br/>
ARCHER: We need to check out the shuttlepod, too. See if any of its
environmental systems were at fault. <br/>
TUCKER: I can do that, Captain. I should've thought of that myself. <br/>
ARCHER: Stay where you are, Trip. Phlox needs blood samples. <br/>
PHLOX: Here's the medkits. <br/>
(He puts them through the decon chamber wall but as Hoshi comes to get
them, she starts coughing.) <br/>
ARCHER: Hoshi, what is it? <br/>
HOSHI: Before Commander Tucker passed out, he started coughing. <br/>
PHLOX: Are you feeling any other symptoms? <br/>
(She dashes into the bathroom and throws up.) <br/>
TUCKER: I'm going to guess that's a yes. <br/>
PHLOX: I'll prepare anti-nausea medication. You get me those blood
samples as soon as you can. <br/>
(Phlox and Archer head off down the corridor.) <br/>
ARCHER: Anything? <br/>
PHLOX: Whatever's afflicting them, it's not showing up on the standard

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TRAVIS: I studied your report on how the Klingons
reacted to the infection. <br/>
REED: Their response was typical for a species at their level of
development. <br/>
TRAVIS: The Klingon commander didn't let his landing party back on his
ship. <br/>
REED: Your point? <br/>
TRAVIS: Captain Archer did. <br/>
REED: Captain Archer's done nothing different from the Klingons. The
launch bay and Decon Chamber are completely isolated from the rest of
the ship. <br/>
TRAVIS: So it doesn't matter if an infected landing party comes aboard.
<br/>
REED: Precisely. Humans don't want to interact with dying crew mates
any more than Klingons did. If it was left to me, I'd stop our
observations immediately. We have nothing more to learn from humans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know. They're showing concern
for each other. The Cardassians did that when they were here, didn't
they? <br/>
REED: Ah, but in the end they killed their infected crew, just as the
Klingons did. The only difference is the time it took to reach that
decision. <br/>
TRAVIS: Maybe the humans will surprise us. <br/>
REED: I've been observing aliens for eight hundred years. I've yet to
be surprised. Still, we should follow protocol. Start questioning the
infected crew. I'll check in with the Doctor. </font></p>

TUCKER: Okay, this is for nausea, muscle pain, and a cough suppressant.
<br/>
HOSHI: I'm not coughing anymore. Neither are you. Maybe we're getting
better. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, Doctor's orders <br/>
(Travis arrives at the window, and knocks to get their attention.) <br/>
TRAVIS: Commander, Hoshi. Just wanted to say hi. <br/>
TUCKER: We're a little busy right now, Travis. <br/>
TRAVIS: Can you tell me what's in the hypospray? <br/>
HOSHI: Something for our symptoms. <br/>
TUCKER: Yeah. Phlox doesn't know what's wrong with us yet. <br/>
TRAVIS: Have either of you faced serious illness before? <br/>
TUCKER: Aren't you supposed to be on duty? <br/>
TRAVIS: I was curious to know how you'd compare this experience with
other illnesses you might've contracted. <br/>
TUCKER: Travis, we really need to get some sleep. <br/>

PHLOX: Of course. Just a moment. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>
(Reed looking at the monitor displays.) </font><br/>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REED:
Are these are the blood tests for Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato? <br/>
PHLOX: That's correct. <br/>
(Phlox scans Reed.) <br/>
PHLOX: I'm not detecting any vascular involvement. <br/>
(Reed looks quizzical.) <br/>
PHLOX: Your headache. Not a bad one, I take it? <br/>
REED: No, not yet. Although it feels like it could get worse.
Preventive measure. A lot to do today. <br/>
PHLOX: Mild analgesic it is. <br/>
(Phlox gives him the shot.) <br/>
REED: Doctor, I'm curious to know how you think these tests will help
you develop an effective treatment. <br/>
PHLOX: So am I. <br/>
REED: I mean, are you approaching this strictly on a symptomatic level,
or do you believe there's any similarity to other conditions you've
seen in the past? <br/>
PHLOX: Lieutenant, I believe I can put your mind at ease. If your
colleagues have returned with a contagious illness, there is no way it
can spread to the rest of the ship. We are all quite safe. <br/>
(Phlox opens the Sickbay doors and gestures for him to leave.) <br/>
REED: I'm not worried about that, no. I'm interested in the methodology
<br/>

TUCKER: You ever see The Andromeda Strain? <br/>
HOSHI: Strain of what? <br/>
TUCKER: No, it's a movie. Mid-twentieth century. <br/>
HOSHI: Let me guess. Doctor Andromeda builds a monster, and it kills
him in the end. <br/>
TUCKER: It's about an extraterrestrial disease. <br/>
HOSHI: All your movies are the same. I can't keep the stories straight.
<br/>
TUCKER: This reminds me of my dorm room at Starfleet Training. Got into
a lot of trouble at old STC. <br/>
HOSHI: I got kicked out. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, you can't stop there. <br/>
HOSHI: In my second month, I had a difference of opinion with the
Company Commander. I broke his arm. <br/>
TUCKER: Can I ask why? <br/>
HOSHI: Poker. <br/>
TUCKER: You broke his arm playing cards? <br/>
HOSHI: He tried to shut down a game I was running for some of the
recruits, and a couple of the training staff. <br/>
TUCKER: Hold on. You ran a floating poker game at STC? <br/>
HOSHI: The way the regulations are worded, gambling was an honour
violation only if it took place during duty hours. So I ran the game on
weekends. One night my C.C. showed up, tried to sweep all the chips off
the table, and I. Well, I have a black belt in aikido. I think he was
just upset that I hadn't invited him to play. <br/>
TUCKER: What happened? <br/>
HOSHI: I got a bad conduct discharge. <br/>
TUCKER: How the hell did you end up on Enterprise? <br/>
HOSHI: Starfleet needed language specialists more than they needed to
make an example out of me. They let me back in on probation, and here I
am. </font></p>

virus. Highly contagious. Silicon-based. <br/>
ARCHER: This is an M class planet. All life forms down there should be
carbon-based. <br/>
PHLOX: I can only surmise the virus was brought here. Perhaps by a
meteorite, which could explain why only one of our landing parties
encountered it. <br/>
ARCHER: Is there a treatment? <br/>
PHLOX: There's no record of anything like it in the Denobulan database.
<br/>
ARCHER: Then it's up to you. <br/>
PHLOX: I'll do all I can, Captain, but at the rate the pathogen is
reproducing, Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato have less than five hours
to live. </font></p>

TUCKER: Next time I ask to go on a landing party, talk me out of it,
okay? <br/>
ARCHER: You're usually too stubborn to be talked out of anything. But
I'll do my best. How's Hoshi? <br/>
TUCKER: Sleeping. Whatever Phlox gave us, at least it's helping with
the pain. <br/>
ARCHER: Phlox identified what's causing all the trouble. A
silicon-based virus. <br/>
TUCKER: I don't suppose he's on his way over here with the cure. <br/>
ARCHER: He's working on it. So is T'Pol. <br/>
TUCKER: So, there is no cure. <br/>
ARCHER: Not yet. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm getting the idea you're up against a deadline. <br/>
ARCHER: If you mean how much time do you have, it's too early for that
kind of talk. Your own immune system could knock this thing out. <br/>
TUCKER: I remember Exobiology 101, Captain. Humans are carbon-based.
Our immune system can't fight silicon. <br/>

intelligence in the species we observe. <br/>
REED: Rational intelligence, yes. Which Archer has not demonstrated.
The longer the infected crew remain on board, the greater the risk that
quarantine will fail. <br/>
TRAVIS: I'm sure Captain Archer knows exactly what the risk is. Maybe
it's not as important to him as standing by his crew. <br/>
REED: It's just as probable that he hasn't realised how hopeless the
situation is. <br/>
TRAVIS: There's a way to be sure. <br/>
REED: We chose the Helmsman and the Armory Officer for good reason.
They're both stationed on the Bridge, yet neither plays a critical role
in a medical emergency. <br/>
TRAVIS: Which is why we should inhabit the Doctor and the Science
Officer. Archer relies on their findings to make his decisions. We
could witness that as it happens. <br/>
REED: The more people we inhabit, the greater the chance that we will
inadvertently interfere. <br/>

HOSHI: That's not how it works. There are a lot of common patterns. I'm
just good at hearing them, that's all. <br/>
TUCKER: Good? You're a genius. The way you can pick up an alien
language you've never heard before and start spouting it back to them?
I got to tell you, I've always been jealous you can do that. <br/>
HOSHI: I wish I could fix warp engines with duct tape and a pocket
knife. <br/>
TUCKER: It's a bit more complicated than that. Sometimes. <br/>
HOSHI: Seriously. Engineering, building things. have you always been
good at that? <br/>
TUCKER: When I was a kid, not so good at building. But I was a terror
when it came to taking things apart. My folks used to put all our
kitchen appliances on the highest shelves. One Thanksgiving, I
have no idea what I was thinking, but I removed every screw from this
big dining room table we had. It was so old, the wood sort of stuck
together, so it stayed standing until my dad put the turkey down. I
spent the next month in my room. <br/>
HOSHI: How old were you? <br/>
TUCKER: Oh, twenty four, twenty five. <br/>
(Hoshi notices T'Pol and Phlox watching through the window.) <br/>

death. <br/>

PHLOX: You want the humans to fail. <br/>
T'POL: This isn't a competition. Either a species' intelligence is
developed enough for First Contact, or it isn't. <br/>
PHLOX: Perhaps we should consider other qualities in making our
decision. <br/>
T'POL: This is the measure we have used for ten thousand years. It's
not our responsibility to change it. <br/>

disrupts the silicon matrix of the virus. <br/>
ARCHER: Sounds promising. <br/>
PHLOX: Unfortunately, the dosage required would be lethal. <br/>
ARCHER: There's got to be some kind of a trade-off. A way to produce
enough radiation to slow down the virus without killing the patient. <br/>

TUCKER: Why should any species have to endure this weakness? <br/>

the limitations of the physical world. <br/>

PHLOX: Captain, T'Pol. I was just coming to see you. These are
brainwave readings of Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato. <br/>
ARCHER: What is the significance? <br/>
PHLOX: The patterns aren't human. <br/>
T'POL: Did you know they had this capability? <br/>
ARCHER: He must have used Denobulan technology. <br/>
PHLOX: I see. Are you responsible for what happened to my patients? <br/>
ARCHER: We had nothing to do with it. <br/>
T'POL: We come here only to study how physical species react to the
unknown. You can help by telling us how you detected our presence. That
happens in less than two percent of our missions. <br/>
PHLOX: Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato were sedated. They shouldn't
have been able to stand and talk. <br/>
ARCHER: It's been so long since we had physical form, we weren't able
to distinguish sleep from sedation. <br/>
T'POL: We'll remember next time. <br/>
PHLOX: Is there anything you can do to help my patients? <br/>
T'POL: We're here to observe. We can't interfere. <br/>
PHLOX: You're interfering with me! <br/>
T'POL: Our subjects are human. You're Denobulan. You were inhabited a
few hours ago. An intriguing experience. <br/>
PHLOX: I have no recollection of that. <br/>
ARCHER: Memories are simple to adjust. <br/>
PHLOX: You're going to adjust mine again? So I won't remember a word of
this encounter. <br/>
T'POL: Or what you observed in the Decon Chamber. <br/>
PHLOX: If you have that ability, you must be able to help my patients. <br/>
ARCHER: We could. <br/>
T'POL: But we won't. Thank you for your help, Doctor. <br/>

medical PADD, he's learned how to stop the infection. <br/>
T'POL: I've seen seven other species develop the radiation cure. But
never in time. <br/>
ARCHER: Did we make First Contact with any of them? <br/>
T'POL: Of course not. Expending resources to attempt an impossible task
is not a sign of intelligence. The Captain and Science Officer have
decisions to make. We need to return to our original hosts. </font></p>

is. <br/>
