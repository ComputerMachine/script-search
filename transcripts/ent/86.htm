Okay, more than a few. <br/>
ARCHER: You haven't stopped talking about this for a week. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, it's different for you. You grew up with the man. When I
was seven, my mom bought me a book about him. Emory Erickson, Father of
the Transporter. I made her read it to me every night for a month. That
book is the reason I became an engineer. <br/>
ARCHER: Did I ever tell you about meeting Zefram Cochrane? <br/>
TUCKER: Yeah, only about fifty times. <br/>
ARCHER: Then you know I understand how you feel. </font></p>

up his uniform.) <br/>
ARCHER: You want a mirror? <br/>
TUCKER: You've got a mean streak in you, you know that? <br/>
(Archer nods, and Trip beams aboard a tall young woman and a man in a
wheelchair.) <br/>
EMORY: Nothing seems to be missing, <br/>
ARCHER: Hello, Emory. <br/>
EMORY: Jonathan, look at you. I always suspected you'd be famous, just
didn't think that you'd be more famous than me. <br/>(They embrace) <br/>
DANICA: Jon. <br/>
ARCHER: Good to see you. (they kiss and hug) <br/>
DANICA: Oh, we have a lot of catching up to do. <br/>
EMORY: Do it later. I want a tour of this place. <br/>
ARCHER: My Chief Engineer, Commander Charles Tucker. <br/>
TUCKER: It's an honour. <br/>
EMORY: Guess you and I'll be spending some time together. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm looking forward to it. <br/>

EMORY: I hope you don't mind that I'm borrowing your ship, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: As long as you return it in good condition. <br/>
EMORY: Don't know if I can promise that. When this test is over,
Enterprise and all of Starfleet could be obsolete. <br/>

T'POL: I'm reading the Kir'Shara. <br/>
TUCKER: How is it? <br/>
T'POL: Interesting. <br/>
TUCKER: Interesting? <br/>
T'POL: Extremely. <br/>
TUCKER: Look, I know what you're going through. Losing a family member,
it's the toughest thing there is. <br/>
T'POL: I see no point in discussing it. It's in the past. <br/>
TUCKER: Your mother died a week ago. <br/>
T'POL: Talking won't change that. <br/>
TUCKER: It may change the way you feel about it. <br/>
T'POL: I don't feel anything about it. <br/>
TUCKER: You can tell yourself that, <br/>
T'POL: It's the truth. <br/>
TUCKER: You know, when Lizzie died, there were times I wanted to just
close up, retreat inside myself, <br/>
T'POL: Trip, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but it's not
necessary. <br/>
TUCKER: You're fine? Well, if you ever do want to talk, let me know.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Five people around the table looks somewhat
crowded.) <br/>
EMORY: Sub-quantum teleportation. You step on to a transporter on
Earth, a few seconds later, you're on Vulcan. <br/>
TUCKER: That's over sixteen light years. <br/>
EMORY: That's just for starters. Theoretically, there's no limit to the
distance. One of the things we're here to test. You tell me, with that
kind of technology who'd have any use for a starship? <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe you will put me out of a job. <br/>
DANICA: Dad, <br/>
EMORY: Well, I wouldn't worry too much. It's going to take decades to
work out all the bugs. But when we do, Starfleet's gonna look a hell of
a lot different. That's if it exists at all. <br/>
DANICA: You can see he hasn't changed. <br/>
ARCHER: I remember you and my father having similar discussions. <br/>
EMORY: He believed the future was in the warp drive, I believed in the
transporter pad. I miss those talks. I miss him. To Henry, <br/>
(They all raise their wine glasses in silent toast.) <br/>
T'POL: The Vulcan Science Academy has been studying sub-quantum
transporting for some time, with little result. <br/>
EMORY: I've been trying to get my hands on some of that research for
years. In hindsight, it's probably just as well that I couldn't.
Might've sent me down the wrong path. <br/>
TUCKER: It's hard to imagine. Beaming someone that far. <br/>
EMORY: All breakthroughs are hard to imagine before they happen. When I
developed the transporter, most people simply couldn't grasp it. Some
still can't. <br/>
ARCHER: I have to confess, given a choice, I'd much rather use a good
old-fashioned shuttlepod. <br/>
EMORY: I'll never forget the protests when the transporter was first
approved for bio-matter. <br/>
DANICA: Oh, God. Here we go. <br/>
EMORY: People said it was unsafe, that it caused brain cancer,
psychosis, and even sleep disorders. And then there was all that
metaphysical chatter about whether or not the person who arrived after
the transport was the same person who left, and not some weird copy. <br/>
TUCKER: Which would make all of us copies. <br/>
EMORY: I had to fight all of that nonsense, and I'm not going to tell
you there weren't costs. I'm living proof of that, but I won. Mankind
is better off. Makes everything I've fought for worthwhile. <br/>
TUCKER: Here's to a successful experiment. <br/>
(This time, Danica does not raise her glass.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's Log, supplemental. We're entering an area
known as the Barrens. There's not a star system within a hundred light

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Erickson and Tucker are making modifications to the
equipment.) <br/>
EMORY: Those early days were pretty terrifying. I'm lucky to be alive. <br/>
TUCKER: Is it true you're the first person to go through? <br/>
EMORY: I wasn't about to let anyone else do it. <br/>
TUCKER: You must've been scared. <br/>
EMORY: Terrified. That original transporter took a full minute and a
half to cycle through. Felt like a year. You could actually feel
yourself being taken apart and put back together. When I materialised,
first thing I did was lose my lunch. Second thing I did was get stone
drunk. Trick I learned from Zefram Cochrane. Now there was a man who
knew the benefits of a little liquid courage. What is it? <br/>
TUCKER: Well, you're going to need more juice than I thought. <br/>
EMORY: Not more than Enterprise can spare. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, we'll have to draw direct from the warp reactor. May even
have to shut down a few systems. <br/>
EMORY: You'll be able to leave the lights on. <br/>
TUCKER: Yeah. if I could get a look at your power converter, it might
help me out. <br/>
EMORY: I'll tell you what. When I'm done with this, I'll install the
converter. See if I can't make life easier on you. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, thanks, but when it comes to modifying our systems, I
prefer to do things myself. Can I get a look at it? <br/>
EMORY: I said I'd install the converter. <br/>
TUCKER: And I said, no, thanks. <br/>
EMORY: I wish I had time to debate the finer points of engineering
protocol, but as you can see I'm extremely busy. And I realise this is
your ship and I'm only a guest, but let me remind you that Starfleet
has granted me complete access to your systems. If you hadn't noticed,
I'm more than capable of handling a little power upgrade. Hand me that,
will you? </font></p>

could describe every one of your missions. <br/>
ARCHER: Still wonder why you haven't signed on. <br/>
DANICA: I think you know the answer. <br/>
ARCHER: Your father seems like he can take care of himself. He sure
hasn't lost any of his edge. <br/>
DANICA: Can't argue with that. <br/>
ARCHER: So, why are you still on Earth? <br/>
DANICA: He needs me. He still hasn't gotten over Quinn. <br/>
ARCHER: It's been fourteen years. <br/>
DANICA: Fifteen. <br/>
ARCHER: He lost a son. If you leave, he'll lose a daughter. <br/>
DANICA: If this test goes well, it'll be a new start for him. Give him
something to look forward to. He won't spend all of his time thinking
about the past. <br/>
ARCHER: And if the test doesn't go well? <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARCHER: Come in. <br/>
TUCKER: Something's wrong. Most of the work Emory had me do, tapping
into the warp reactor for extra power, re-routing the plasma flow. It
wasn't necessary for the test. <br/>
ARCHER: What are you saying? <br/>
TUCKER: Remember when the lights dimmed? <br/>
ARCHER: Yeah. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, he channeled that energy into a feedback loop. It wasn't
going into the beam. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe he needs the power for another phase of the experiment. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, from what I can tell, his sub-quantum version should use
less energy than a regular transporter. That's one of the reasons it's
so brilliant. Either he was keeping me busy, making sure I was looking
the other way, or this sub-quantum thing is a smoke screen for
something else. Something he hasn't told us about. I wouldn't have
picked up on any of it if you hadn't asked me to take a closer look. <br/>
ARCHER: When I asked Emory about the anomaly that killed Burrows, he
claimed he'd never heard of anything like it. <br/>
TUCKER: Not true? <br/>
ARCHER: Something very similar appeared on Emory's research ship five
years ago. T'Pol dug up the report from Starfleet's data banks. A crew
member saw it. Said it seemed to be alive. <br/>

ARCHER: What are you talking about? <br/>
EMORY: We were conducting first trials. My greatest achievement. Quinn
wanted to be the first to go through. He was a lot like his old man. A
lot like you. I lost his signal and couldn't get it back. Truth is, the
sub-quantum transporter is a fundamentally flawed concept. It'll never
work. Not now, not a thousand years from now. I suppose I knew that at
the time. <br/>
ARCHER: You let him go through with the test? <br/>
EMORY: I was a relatively young man who had created something that
changed Starfleet. After an achievement of that magnitude, there was
nowhere to go but down. My life became just one long struggle to
recapture past glory. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about Quinn. <br/>
EMORY: I wasn't thinking of the consequences. <br/>
ARCHER: You said you came here to get him back? <br/>
EMORY: This region, the Barrens, is actually a subspace node, a bubble
of curved space-time. It's why there are no stars. Quinn's transporter
signal is trapped here. At certain intervals, there are fluctuations in
the node that cause the signal to reappear. If we can lock onto it at
one of those intervals we can save him. <br/>
ARCHER: You could've told me all of this before. <br/>
EMORY: Starfleet would never have authorised the mission. I had to
create an excuse. <br/>
ARCHER: A member of my crew is dead. <br/>
EMORY: I didn't know that the manifestations would be dangerous,
believe me. <br/>
ARCHER: You want me to believe you? <br/>
EMORY: I want you to help me. Quinn was like a brother to you. <br/>

ARCHER: I'm aware of that. But we're here. We can't just turn the ship
around and leave a man to die. You have your orders. I suggest you get
started. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TUCKER: We're still getting a spike in the array. I
could swap out the emitter coils with something from Engineering. Might
even out a bit. <br/>
EMORY: Sounds good. <br/>
TUCKER: I'll get on it. <br/>
EMORY: I know you don't approve of what I've done. <br/>
TUCKER: You need my approval? <br/>
EMORY: I'm disappointed that you think less of me. <br/>
TUCKER: You liked me better when I worshipped your shadow? <br/>
EMORY: Yes. It's an honest answer. <br/>
TUCKER: I'd think you'd be out of practice. <br/>
EMORY: You may want to reserve judgment on my actions until you've lost
a son. <br/>
TUCKER: I have lost someone close, and I'd do almost anything to get
her back. Except put other people in danger. <br/>
EMORY: Quinn and I used to argue all the time. Wasn't until I lost him
that I realised that those arguments were some of the happiest moments
of my life. <br/>
TUCKER: I'll be in Engineering. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DANICA: Can I come in? Hey there. You must be
Porthos. I've heard a lot about you. (moves to stroke him and the
little dog immediately presents his tummy for scratching) He's got a
lot of personality. <br/>
ARCHER: And an appetite to match. <br/>
DANICA: I wanted to say that I'm sorry. I should've come to you
earlier. I feel responsible. You lost a crewman. <br/>
ARCHER: We can't change what's happened. Maybe some good can come out
of it. <br/>
DANICA: You think we can get him back? <br/>
EMORY: I think that it's possible. That's enough reason for me to try. <br/>
DANICA: I wonder what it must be like for him, you know? Is he in pain?
Is he conscious? If he is, does he think that we've forgotten about
him? Quinn was everything to my father. To both of us. Getting him back
is all that we've thought about for the past fifteen years. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's hope when this is over, you'll have something else to
think about. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">T'POL: The power conversion tables. Some of these
modifications should help. <br/>
TUCKER: Thanks. <br/>
T'POL: Is there anything else? <br/>
TUCKER: No, I think we're pretty much there. (she turns to go) I'm
trying to decide what to show for movie night. <br/>
T'POL: Movie night? <br/>
TUCKER: Yeah, I thought I'd fire up the old tradition. You in the mood
for a horror film or a musical? <br/>
T'POL: I don't think I'll have the time for either. <br/>
TUCKER: You can't spend every second of your life studying that,
whatever it's called. <br/>
T'POL: Kir'Shara. <br/>
TUCKER: You got to take a break eventually. <br/>
T'POL: Eventually. <br/>
TUCKER: I don't get you, T'Pol. I thought you joined Starfleet so you
could interact a little more with humans. But it seems to me that ever
since we left spacedock, you spend all your free time cooped up in your
room reading that bible of yours. <br/>
T'POL: I may have found new priorities. <br/>
TUCKER: What's that supposed to mean? <br/>
T'POL: I'm needed on the Bridge. </font></p>

EMORY: Quinn? Quinn? <br/>

to Emory just in time to protect him.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TUCKER: It knocked out an EPS junction. Repair's
going to take a couple of hours. <br/>
ARCHER: Will it affect the transporter? <br/>
TUCKER: No. I can't believe you're still going through with this. <br/>
ARCHER: We're not going to have this argument again. <br/>
TUCKER: That thing barely missed a stack of torpedoes. If it had jumped
two feet to the left we wouldn't be here to talk about it. We should
concentrate on repairing the ship so we can get out of here. <br/>
ARCHER: If we beam Quinn aboard there won't be any more of these
manifestations. <br/>
TUCKER: How the hell do you know? <br/>
ARCHER: Trip. <br/>
TUCKER: You're putting your personal feelings before the safety of this
ship. <br/>
ARCHER: And you are this close to insubordination. <br/>
TUCKER: Insubordination? <br/>
ARCHER: I've made a decision. It's the right decision, and the
discussion is over. Can you accept that? Now go do your job. <br/>

get a good lock when he reappears. <br/>
ARCHER: When will that be? <br/>
EMORY: Just over three hours. How's your ship? <br/>
ARCHER: We're ready. <br/>
EMORY: You saved my life <br/>
ARCHER: Forget it. <br/>
EMORY: You didn't deserve any of this, Jonathan. I'm sorry this became
your problem. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's make it worthwhile. Let's get Quinn back. <br/>
EMORY: I'm scared. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't blame you. <br/>
EMORY: I've waited so long for this moment. Planned for it. What if
something goes wrong? What if I fail? <br/>
ARCHER: On the day before I entered flight training, I asked my father
pretty much the same thing. <br/>

(The energy figure starts to appear.) <br/>
EMORY: We need more power. <br/>
TUCKER: That's all we got. <br/>
EMORY: It's working. <br/>
(The figure moves, arms reach out, and the face is briefly
recognisable.) <br/>
DANICA: Quinn. <br/>
EMORY: (losing him) No. No. <br/>(Phlox scans the figure.) <br/>EMORY: Complete the
transport sequence. <br/>
TUCKER: I don't have a strong enough signal. <br/>
EMORY: Recalibrate the confinement beam. <br/>
TUCKER: That won't help get us a lock. <br/>
EMORY: Just do it. <br/>
PHLOX: I'm reading massive cellular deterioration. <br/>
EMORY: That's not possible. <br/>
PHLOX: He's losing cohesion. If he materialises, he'll die in seconds. <br/>
EMORY: I can reverse the damage by cross-phasing the stream. <br/>
TUCKER: The transporter can't do that. <br/>
EMORY: I built the damn thing! <br/>
PHLOX: I'm losing his vital signs. <br/>
ARCHER: Emory, <br/>

way. <br/>
EMORY: I came here to bring my son home. I suppose I accomplished my
goal. <br/>
ARCHER: I've been in contact with Starfleet. <br/>
EMORY: I imagine they're not too happy with all of this. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sure they'll take your achievements into consideration. <br/>
EMORY: I perpetrated a fraud to obtain the use of your ship. A member
of your crew is dead. There's no way I'm going to avoid the
consequences. There's one good thing to come out of this. Dani won't
have to worry about taking care of me anymore. I managed to let go of
one of my children. Now I guess it's time for me to let go of the other
one. <br/>
ARCHER: I always thought she should be out here. <br/>
EMORY: Maybe they'll put me somewhere where I'll be useful. Get a
chance to teach. <br/>

T'POL: It's still difficult for me to accept. <br/>
PHLOX: You were diagnosed with an incurable disease. Now it's gone.
It's a big adjustment. From what I've been reading, similar diagnoses
are taking place all over Vulcan. People with Pa'Nar are coming
forward. It's no longer a stigma. <br/>
T'POL: The Kir'Shara is having an enormous impact. <br/>
PHLOX: It's clearly had an impact on you. You seem more certain of
yourself. <br/>
