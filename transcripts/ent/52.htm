Xindi. They learned that their world would be destroyed by humans in
four hundred years. <br/>
ARCHER: How would they know what's going to happen in four hundred
years? <br/>
FUTURE MAN: They were told by people from the future. People who can
communicate through time. <br/>
ARCHER: Are they the ones the Suliban are working for? <br/>
FUTURE MAN: The Suliban work for me. <br/>
ARCHER: So you're the one who tried to start a civil war in the Klingon
Empire, the one who's manipulated my mission from day one. <br/>
FUTURE MAN: The people who have contacted the Xindi belong to another
faction. The probe was only a test. The Xindi are building a far more
powerful weapon. When it is completed, they will use it to destroy
Earth. <br/>
ARCHER: Annihilate us before we can annihilate them. Why are you
telling me this? <br/>FUTURE MAN: The Xindi were not supposed to learn of
their future. If they deploy this weapon, it will contaminate the
timeline. You must not let that happen. <br/>

FORREST: I told Command everything you said. They're having a hard time
buying it. <br/>
ARCHER: Do they have a better idea of who did this? And how about the
Vulcans? I suppose you think I'm hallucinating. <br/>
SOVAL: Our Science Directorate has determined that time travel is
impossible. <br/>
ARCHER: Are you willing to risk a second attack? All I'm asking is to
take Enterprise and find these Xindi. What do we have to lose, a single
starship. Seems like a small price to pay if there's one chance in a
million that he's right. <br/>
SOVAL: Do you know where these co-ordinates he gave you are? <br/>
ARCHER: At warp five, about a three month trip. <br/>
SOVAL: They're inside the Delphic Expanse. <br/>
ARCHER: What's that? <br/>
SOVAL: A region of space nearly two thousand light years across. Vulcan
ships have entered it, but only a few have returned. <br/>
ARCHER: Sounds like your talking about the Bermuda Triangle. <br/>
SOVAL: There has been reports of fierce and dangerous species,
unexplained anomalies. In some regions, even the laws of physics don't
apply. Twenty years ago, a Klingon vessel emerged from the Expanse.
Every crewmen on board has been anatomically inverted, their bodies
splayed open, and they were still alive. You'd be more than foolish to
pursue this course of action. <br/>
ARCHER: It's a risk I'm willing to take, and I imagine most of my crew
would be with me. <br/>
SOVAL: This is typical of your impulsiveness. You'd be putting your
crew's lives at stake when you have no evidence that anything you were
told were true. <br/>

would need some kind of proof before they let you go. <br/>

communicate through time, so how do you suggest they get this component

these scanners. This fragment's from the future, unless you have
another explanation. <br/>

correct. <br/>

on its way with two hundred snow beetles. <br/>
PHLOX: They could be for my replacement. <br/>
T'POL: There isn't a doctor in Starfleet that would have the slightest
idea what to do with them. <br/>
PHLOX: And what about you? <br/>
T'POL: The High Command has made it clear that they don't want me to
enter the Delphic Expanse. <br/>
PHLOX: I'm much more interested in hearing what you want. <br/>
T'POL: it's not my place to disobey the High Command. <br/>
PHLOX: Nonsense. You've done it before. It's interesting. You and I,
the only aliens on board this vessel. To go or to stay. For me, it was
a simple question of loyalty towards the Captain and the sad
realisation that he'll need me more then ever on such a crucial
mission. But for you it's a more difficult decision. Does your
allegiance lie with the High Command or with Captain Archer? </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(A crewwoman wheels in a box.) </font><br/><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

that. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm getting real tired of you telling me what I can and can't
do. And while we're at it, I don't need you to remind me that Elizabeth

Vaankara was in the Delphic Expanse for less then two days when we
received a distress call. This transmission arrived six hours later.

back to Vulcan for some time. You may find your assignment at the

T'POL: I don't understand why I can't stay in San Francisco. <br/>
SOVAL: You've spent far to much time with humans. It would be best if
you returned home for a while. <br/>
T'POL: You thought it was crucial to place a Vulcan on Enterprise
during its first mission. Why not now? <br/>
SOVAL: You were there to provide logic to a crew of humans who insisted
on leaving before they were ready, but logic can't help them inside the
Delphic Expanse. <br/>
T'POL: Can you be certain of that? <br/>
SOVAL: The High Command was quite specific. You're to return to Vulcan.
<br/>
T'POL: I believe that should be my decision. <br/>

mean immediate dismissal. You know that. </font></p>

about as big as a responsibility as I could imagined. Then, we began
running into so many bad guys, and I had to start thinking more about
the safety of eighty three people. <br/>
