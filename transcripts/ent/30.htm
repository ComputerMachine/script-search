gel on T'Pol's back, while T'Pol is smothering Archer's back and he is
treating Porthos.) <br/>
ARCHER: Starfleet didn't send us out here to humiliate ourselves. How
long were we in orbit, grovelling? Six days? <br/>
HOSHI: Five, sir, and it wasn't exactly grovelling. <br/>
ARCHER: Apologising, asking forgiveness, just because we ate lunch in
front of them on our own ship months ago. I call that grovelling. <br/>
HOSHI: They were offended. <br/>
T'POL: The Kreetassans manufacture plasma injectors. We need one. <br/>
ARCHER: So we spend six days grovelling. <br/>
HOSHI: Five days. <br/>
ARCHER: And when they finally agree to talk to us, we go down. And what
do they do? They keep us waiting for twelve hours and then send us
packing. No explanation, no plasma injector. Just leave, go back to
your ship. <br/>
T'POL: We obviously offended them again. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe my hair's parted on the wrong side. I'm exhausted, and
I've had it with these people. <br/>
HOSHI: (answering comm.) Go ahead. <br/>
PHLOX [OC]: The three of you are clear to go, but I'm afraid I'll need
to keep Porthos for a while. <br/>
ARCHER: What's the problem? <br/>
PHLOX [OC]: He picked up a pathogen of some kind on the surface.
Neither decon agent has been effective. <br/>
ARCHER: What are you going to do? <br/>
PHLOX [OC]: I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know as soon as I run some
tests. <br/>
HOSHI: (as she and T'Pol leave) Feel better, Porthos. <br/>
ARCHER: Doc'll have you good as new before you know it. I might even
break the no-cheese rule tonight. <br/>(Archer goes to leave, and Porthos whimpers.)

just a matter of time before this injector gives up the ghost. <br/>
ARCHER: You've got four more. The ship can run on four. <br/>
TUCKER: Yeah, but it can't run on three. You know what happens at warp
speed when you've only got three plasma injectors online. <br/>
ARCHER: What are the odds of us losing another one before we find a
replacement? <br/>
TUCKER: I'm not comfortable with four, Captain. We need five. What the
hell happened down there, anyway? <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pol thinks we insulted them again. <br/>
TUCKER: How? You didn't eat cabbage before you left. <br/>
ARCHER: I was a perfect gentleman. We're going to have to go somewhere
else to find you your injector, Trip. These people are impossible. <br/>
TUCKER: Their components are metallurgically sound, dependable. We
could look for six months and not find anything half as compatible.
You're a trained diplomat. Take the high road. There's got to be some
way you can kiss and make up. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll have T'Pol see if she can find out what we did, but I'm
not promising anything. </font></p>

with Porthos. Is every <br/>(He sees Porthos looking unhappy in an isolation
box with rubber gloves to prevent direct contact.) <br/>
PHLOX: It's all right to pet him. You'll have to use the isolation
gloves. <br/>
ARCHER: Did you run your tests? <br/>
PHLOX: His auto-immune system is collapsing. I've isolated the
pathogen, broken down its protein sequence. I can't explain it,
Captain. It shouldn't be affecting him like this, but it is. <br/>
ARCHER: So what are you doing? <br/>
PHLOX: Running more tests. I'm sure I'll come up with something. <br/>
ARCHER: How sure? Could this be life-threatening? <br/>
PHLOX: It's too early to tell. <br/>
ARCHER: Didn't we send his genome to the Kreetassans along with ours? <br/>
PHLOX: I transmitted them myself before you left Enterprise. <br/>
ARCHER: So shouldn't they have noticed there's a pathogen in their
atmosphere that his immune system can't handle? <br/>
PHLOX: They should have, assuming they took the time to check. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm told I've offended these people twice. Once for eating in
front of them, the second time, I don't even know what for. But if
their carelessness has hurt Porthos or, God forbid, ends up killing
him, they're going to find out what being offended is all about. <br/>
PHLOX: Porthos has no intention of giving up, and neither do I. <br/>
ARCHER: You hear that, boy? <br/>(He uses a glove to rub Porthos' chest.) <br/>ARCHER: We're
all pulling for you. </font></p>

T'POL: Yes. <br/>
ARCHER: And? <br/>
T'POL: I think we should discuss this in your ready room. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: Well? <br/>
T'POL: Do you recall the stand of trees outside the Hall of Diplomacy? <br/>
ARCHER: What are you talking about? <br/>
T'POL: They're Alvera trees, over three hundred years old. <br/>
ARCHER: That's fascinating. Did you apologise for whatever we did
wrong? Are we going to get our plasma injector? <br/>
T'POL: The Kreetassans consider the Alvera trees cultural treasures.
Apparently, Porthos urinated on one of them. <br/>
ARCHER: And that's what they're insulted about? <br/>
T'POL: It is understandable. <br/>
ARCHER: Well, maybe if they'd bothered to read the genetic profile we
sent they'd have told us to leave the dog on the ship, and then he
wouldn't have had an opportunity to pee on one of their precious trees.
<br/>
T'POL: I conveyed your sincerest apologies to the Chancellery. They're
discussing possible acts of contrition. <br/>
ARCHER: Where the hell do you get off conveying my sincerest apologies?
They're the ones who should be sorry. <br/>
T'POL: I don't need to remind you that Commander Tucker is relying on
us. <br/>
ARCHER: There are some things more important than plasma injectors. <br/>
T'POL: Are you referring to your pride? <br/>
ARCHER: I'll tell you one thing, Sub-Commander. If anything happens to
Porthos, I'll be the one watering their Alvera trees. <br/>(Archer leaves. In his quarters at 10:32 pm he's bouncing a water polo ball against the wall
a la 'Cooler King' while a game is playing on his monitor. Then he
looks at Porthos's cushion, picks up a blanket and leaves.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Phlox watches Archer walk in with the blanket and pillow.) <br/>
PHLOX: If you were a married man I'd be wondering if your wife had
thrown you out. <br/>
ARCHER: I just thought it might cheer Porthos up if I slept here
tonight. That is, if it's all right with you. <br/>
PHLOX: I don't think your dog is in any condition to know whether
you're here or not. <br/>
ARCHER: Well then, maybe it'll cheer me up. <br/>
PHLOX: Be my guest. Take your pick. (gestures to biobeds) <br/>
ARCHER: How's Porthos doing? <br/>
PHLOX: My sub-mammalian database contains no pertinent files on bugles,
but there's sufficient information on similar chordata. <br/>
ARCHER: Beagles. <br/>
PHLOX: Yes. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Archer makes up his temporary bed.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
ARCHER: Let me ask you a question, Doc,
just out of curiosity. Are there any dogs on your homeworld? <br/>
PHLOX: The Denobulan Lemur is highly sought-after. It's not exactly a
dog, but you could say it's doglike. It has a tail, fur. Most have one
head. <br/>
ARCHER: Did your medical training include any <br/>
PHLOX: Captain, please. You needn't be concerned. I hold six degrees in
Interspecies Veterinary Medicine. <br/>
ARCHER: I thought you were just, you know, a people doctor. <br/>
PHLOX: As a matter of fact I've also earned degrees in dentistry,
hematology, botanical pharmacology. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm impressed. So, how's he doing? <br/>
PHLOX: I believe I've eliminated the pathogen. The question is whether
the treatment I've devised will stabilise his auto-immune system before
<br/>
ARCHER: Before what? <br/>
PHLOX: In a few hours, I'll have a more detailed prognosis. <br/>
ARCHER: Before what, Doctor? <br/>
PHLOX: There are many harmless strains of bacteria that can become
lethal when the immune system is compromised, but it is too early to be
thinking about that. Now, we should both try to get a few hours of
rest. If there are any changes in his vital signs the alarms are quite
loud. Good night. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Archer speaks to a patently fake beagle.)</font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
ARCHER:  I would have brought you some
cheese, but Doctor Phlox wouldn't have let me give you any. <br/>
(Archer goes to bed, draws a curtain around it, lies down and dims the lights. A
metallic grinding sound gets him up again.) <br/>
ARCHER: Doctor, are you all right? <br/>
PHLOX: I'm sorry, Captain. Did I wake you? Just trimming my toenails.
They grow quite rapidly. Have to keep them groomed at least once a
week. <br/>
ARCHER: Just wanted to be sure you're okay. <br/>
PHLOX: Thanks for your concern. Good night. <br/>(He carries on slicing about
an inch of brown nail off his toes. Archer returns to his bed and Phlox
feeds his nail trimmings to something in a cage. Then we're treated to
the sight of Phlox scraping an extremely long tongue. Later, Archer
wakes from sleep to the sound of animals chirping. He gets up to see
Phlox doing a feeding round.) <br/>
PHLOX: I'm sorry, Captain. Did I wake you again? <br/>
ARCHER: What the hell's going on? <br/>
PHLOX: Feeding time. <br/>(He sprinkles something into a tank of water and a
mass of bubbles arises.) <br/>PHLOX: Don't be greedy. <br/>
ARCHER: How long was I asleep? <br/>
PHLOX: Nearly an hour. <br/>
ARCHER: Does this go on every night? <br/>
PHLOX: Only when I'm here. They're very demanding when they know I'm in
Sickbay. <br/>
ARCHER: Great. Porthos? <br/>
PHLOX: I'll still need at least a couple of hours. <br/>
ARCHER: Is he comfortable? <br/>
PHLOX: He's fast asleep. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm glad to see someone is. I'll check back in a couple of
hours. <br/>(Archer leaves.) </font></p>

breathing.) <br/></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: How's your dog? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Archer starts on another treadmill.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
ARCHER: Nice of you to ask. We'll know
in a couple of hours. <br/>(She speeds up her machine, he does the same.)
<br/>ARCHER: Have you heard from your friends on the surface? <br/>
T'POL: Not yet. <br/>
ARCHER: I guess they haven't finished compiling their list of
punishments. <br/>
T'POL: They're not interested in punishing you. They only want an
appropriate apology. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sorry. <br/>

ARCHER: Just practicing. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(T'Pol speeds up her machine again, so he does the same.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
T'POL: You
shouldn't have brought your dog on a diplomatic mission, especially
considering we had previously offended the Kreetassans. <br/>
ARCHER: They knew we were bringing him. We even sent his genetic specs.
<br/>(He is getting breathless.) <br/>ARCHER: They could have asked us to leave him behind. They
didn't. Porthos has the right to a little fresh air. <br/>
T'POL: You're once again ignoring the consequences of your actions. <br/>
ARCHER: What's that supposed to mean? <br/>
T'POL: You obviously place more importance on the quality of the air
your pet breathes than on the quality of the plasma that drives your
ship. <br/>(She speeds up her machine again.) <br/>
ARCHER: What the hell does one have to do with the other? Isn't it
logical I could care about my ship and my dog? <br/>(He speeds up his
treadmill.) <br/>
T'POL: I'm not questioning your pluralities. I'm questioning your
priorities. <br/>
ARCHER: (sweating and panting) I really thought you were beginning to
understand something about human feelings. <br/>
T'POL: Not when it pertains to primitive quadrupeds who haven't
developed the ability to speak or to use a toilet. <br/>(She stops her treadmill
and gets off.) <br/>
ARCHER: What's the matter? <br/>
T'POL: I obviously can't keep up with you. (comm. beeps) T'Pol. <br/>(Archer
stops his machine and mops his brow.) <br/>

here about standing on one foot with my eyes shut, reciting The Night
Before Christmas. I'm going back to Sickbay to see if I can get an
hour's sleep before the Doctor's results come through. Let me know if
this fits with your definition of an appropriate apology. <br/>(he leaves.) <br/>

PHLOX: He's gone into anaphylactic shock. His body's rejecting the
treatment I selected. <br/>

PHLOX: You asked me if he was going to die. <br/>
ARCHER: Are you trying a different treatment? Let me guess. We'll know
in. <br/>
PHLOX: A couple of hours, yes. How are things progressing with the
Kreetassans? <br/>
ARCHER: They've got a perfectly good plasma injector sitting on a shelf
somewhere. But will they share it with us? Not until I make a fool of
myself by going through some series of ritual apologies. The fact that
Porthos is on death's doorstep doesn't seem to bother any of them.
They're the ones who should be apologising, not me. T'Pol thinks I care
more about my dog than my ship. Isn't that delightful. <br/>
PHLOX: Why does T'Pol's opinion concern you? <br/>
ARCHER: She's my Science Officer, my second-in-command. She should know
more than anyone aboard how dedicated I am to this mission. To every
member of my crew. <br/>
PHLOX: You didn't answer my question. <br/>
ARCHER: Porthos has one paw in Beagle heaven because these jerks didn't
bother to look at his genetic profile. Am I supposed to ignore that? <br/>
PHLOX: I would think you'd be more interested in Commander Tucker's
opinion. You've known him for many years, if I'm not mistaken. <br/>
ARCHER: It would be nice to have all five plasma injectors working but
it's not essential. We can do fine with four, and the fifth one just
started to act up. We might get another ten light years out of it. <br/>
PHLOX: Have you considered that your anger may encompass more than just
Porthos and the Kreetassans? <br/>
ARCHER: What? <br/>
PHLOX: How long has it been since you were intimate with a woman? <br/>
ARCHER: What! <br/>
PHLOX: How long has it been. <br/>
ARCHER: I heard you! I suppose you're going to tell me you have a
degree in psychiatry, too. <br/>
PHLOX: Absolutely. <br/>
ARCHER: No way. Not a chance. Porthos is the only patient you're
treating right now. You got that? Let me know if there's any change. <br/>

noticed increasing friction between you and the Sub-Commander. You must
understand that I'm trained to observe these things. <br/>

ARCHER: I'll let you know in a couple of hours. <br/>(Hoshi leaves.)
<br/>ARCHER: Everything okay? <br/>
PHLOX: Nothing new. I'll stay with him. <br/>
ARCHER: Thanks. <br/>
PHLOX: Unless you'd like to continue our discussion regarding
Sub-Commander T'Pol. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Pet Graveyard, pouring with rain]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The senior staff are in dark suits under
umbrellas.) <br/>
PHLOX: (in clerical collar) We are gathered here today to bid a final
farewell to a faithful and kind colleague. A friend who would never
hesitate to offer his paw in exchange for a simple smile or a slice of
cheese. Like his namesake, this quadruped believed we should stand
together. 'All for one and one for all'. <br/>(T'Pol moves close to Archer
and gazes into his eyes, then holds his hand.) <br/>PHLOX: When one person believes their sexual attraction toward another is
inappropriate they often exhibit unexpected behaviour. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Decon]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Situation as in the first scene.) <br/>
HOSHI: Go ahead. <br/>
PHLOX [OC]: Hoshi, you and the dog are clear to go, but I'm afraid I'll
need to keep the other two for a while. <br/>
ARCHER: What's the problem? <br/>
PHLOX [OC]: You both picked up a pathogen on the surface. We'll have to
try another decon agent. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(He picks up Porthos and leaves.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
HOSHI: Feel better. <br/>
(T'Pol isn't wearing a top when they face each other to massage decon
gel into each others shoulders.) <br/>
PHLOX [OC]: Tell me, Captain, have you thought any more about why
T'Pol's opinion is so important to you? How long has it been since you
were intimate with a woman? <br/>(They kiss.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay - 2:49 am]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: I dreamt Porthos died. <br/>
PHLOX: Let's hope your dream wasn't prophetic. <br/>
ARCHER: Any indication on how your second treatment's doing? <br/>
PHLOX: It doesn't appear to be doing very well. <br/>
ARCHER: An old girlfriend's mother had this Beagle I was crazy about.
Even after her daughter and I broke up, we stayed in touch. When the
dog got pregnant, I was the first one she called. Four males in the
litter. The four musketeers. I've had Porthos since he was six weeks
old. I grew up with dogs. Can't remember not having one. You have any
pets when you were a kid? <br/>
PHLOX: My people don't keep pets. <br/>
ARCHER: I thought you said something about the Denobulan Lemur being
highly sought after. <br/>
PHLOX: Oh, very much so. Their kidneys are considered a great delicacy.
<br/>
(T'Pol enters with a tray and two covered plates.) <br/>
T'POL: I thought you might be hungry. <br/>
PHLOX: How very kind. <br/>
ARCHER: Was there something on their list about apologising on a full
stomach? <br/>
T'POL: You read the Kreetassan's document? <br/>
ARCHER: Sorry. Sorry, I'm a little on edge. I haven't slept very much
but I'm doing the breast I, the best I can. <br/>
T'POL: I understand. Ensign Sato and I have broken down the
reconciliation demands into specific categories, if you're interested
in reviewing them. <br/>
ARCHER: My only concern right now is Porthos. <br/>
T'POL: I'm sorry to have interrupted. <br/>
ARCHER: No. No, it, it's okay. When you get back to the Bridge, why
don't you send me your lips. Lisp. List. <br/>
(T'Pol gives him a long look and then leaves) <br/>
PHLOX: Two Pillarian slips within thirty seconds. Interesting. <br/>
(the alarm goes off on Porthos's monitor) <br/>
ARCHER: What are you doing? <br/>
PHLOX: My treatment was effective, at least partially. His immune
system is stabilising but his pituitary gland was severely damaged.
It's all but disintegrated. Bring me the small grey cage on the second
shelf. The one with the blue top. <br/>
ARCHER: What's in here? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Phlox is wheeling in a large transparent tank.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PHLOX: A Calrissian Chameleon.
Fill this for me. <br/>(He hands a shower head to Archer.) <br/>PHLOX: I'll need to alter its
DNA to avoid rejection but its pituitary gland should be compatible
with your dog's. <br/>
ARCHER: You're going to perform a transplant from a lizard? <br/>
PHLOX: Unless you have a better suggestion. It's a shame, actually. The
chameleon secretes a rare toxin that's very useful in treating
respiratory infections. She's the last one I have. <br/>
ARCHER: What's the tank for? <br/>
PHLOX: I'll need to super-hydrate the canine in order to minimize the
shock to his pulmonary system. <br/>
ARCHER: You're going to drown my dog? <br/>
PHLOX: Only for an hour, Captain. There should be no problem
resuscitating him once the surgery's complete. <br/>
ARCHER: How many times have you done this before? <br/>
PHLOX: Never. <br/>
ARCHER: Has anyone done this before? <br/>
PHLOX: Not to my knowledge. <br/>
ARCHER: You know, this isn't some guinea pig you're working on here.
This is Porthos, my Beagle, my pal. From what you're telling me the
closest thing your people have to pets are furry little things that go
well with onions. <br/>
PHLOX: Perhaps you're right, Captain. Perhaps I'm insensitive to the
bond between you and your subservient quadruped. I'll leave the
procedure up to you. But whatever your decision, make it quickly. <br/>
(3:44 am, they are both wearing operating gowns. The chameleon is on a
platter and Porthos is in the tank.) <br/>
ARCHER: Just for the sake of argument let's say that some of my anger
toward T'Pol had a component of sexual tension to it. I'm not saying it
does but just for the sake of argument. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Phlox is transplanting the pituitary into Porthos's brain.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
PHLOX: Yes? <br/>
ARCHER: What do you mean, yes? You're the psychiatrist. What am I
supposed to do about it? Am I supposed I to ignore it? Am I supposed to
say something to her? <br/>
PHLOX: Neither. <br/>
ARCHER: Neither? <br/>
PHLOX: If you were ignoring it, you obviously wouldn't be seeking my
opinion especially under these circumstances. As for discussing it with
the Sub-Commander that's entirely up to you, but I can't imagine an
outcome that would do anything but make matters worse. Pass me the
auto-suture, please. The yellow one. <br/>
ARCHER: When will we know if the transplant's working? <br/>
PHLOX: One step at a time. First we need to resuscitate him. <br/>
ARCHER: So I can't ignore it, and I can't talk about it. What do you
suggest I do? <br/>
PHLOX: Be aware of it, Captain. Simply be aware of it. You'd be
surprised what a difference that'll make. Lower the fluidic temperature
twelve degrees. <br/>
ARCHER: If Porthos pulls through, will he need a special diet or
treatments having a chameleon's pituitary gland? <br/>
PHLOX: You may have trouble finding him. He'll have the ability to
blend into his background when frightened. <br/>
ARCHER: You're kidding. <br/>
PHLOX: Yes, I am. <br/>
ARCHER: Does your expertise on sexual tension come from professional
training or firsthand experience? <br/>
PHLOX: I do have three wives. <br/>
ARCHER: And they each have <br/>
PHLOX: Two husbands, besides myself. <br/>
ARCHER: Sounds very complicated. <br/>
PHLOX: Very. Why else be polygamous? <br/>
ARCHER: So, these three wives. <br/>
PHLOX: Each have three husbands. A total of seven hundred and twenty
relationships, forty two of which have romantic possibilities. <br/>
ARCHER: You told me you had five children. How many are there in this
whole extended family? <br/>
PHLOX: Thirty one, at last count. <br/>
ARCHER: You must miss them. You've been away for over two years. <br/>
PHLOX: I'm ready for the synaptic inductor, the small blue one. My
children all left the nest years ago, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: I would have never guessed. You don't look that old. <br/>
PHLOX: I'll take that as a compliment. My two daughters, I'm proud to
say, followed in my footsteps. One's a surgeon, the other's a
biochemist. <br/>
ARCHER: How about the other three? <br/>
PHLOX: My eldest son's an artist. A potter, actually. He lives in the
same town as his mother. Creates beautiful things. <br/>
ARCHER: And the other two? <br/>
PHLOX: My two younger sons and I never saw eye-to-eye. I'm afraid we
haven't spoken in quite some time. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. <br/>
PHLOX: Perfectly all right. You asked me if I missed them. The answer
is yes, every one of them. The children, the wives, even the other
husbands. But we Denobulans live a long time, Captain, and right now
there is nowhere I'd rather be than serving with the Interspecies
Medical Exchange aboard this wonderful vessel of yours. <br/>
ARCHER: Listen, Doc, however this turns out I want to apologise for
accusing you of being insensitive before. <br/>
PHLOX: As I recall, you accused my entire species of being insensitive.
Then I apologise to you and all your fellow Denobulans. <br/>
PHLOX: Well, I can't speak for the others, but, on behalf of myself, I
accept. And to think T'Pol told me you were incapable of apologising. </font></p>

two spares out of the kindness of their hearts? <br/>
T'POL: Evidently the finesse you exhibited outside the Hall of

quarters for extended periods of time. <br/>

of the opposite sex. <br/>
T'POL: Then it's good that you're my superior officer. That we're not
in a position to allow ourselves to become attracted to one another,
