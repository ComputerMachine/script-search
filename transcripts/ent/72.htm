          ship. She took more than anyone could ask her to and then some, and so have all of you. I wanted to say 
          thank you. I only wish I could thank the eighteen crewmen who were lost. Like you, they understood how 
          important our mission is and they accepted the risks. We came into the Expanse not knowing what we'd find, 
          with no one to rely on but ourselves, but we're going to succeed, to accomplish our mission, for everyone 
          on Earth who's relying on us, and for the eighteen.

          Commander Tucker reassigned the repair team that was working here. He said the Armoury was

          That's good news. What is it? <br/>
          T'POL: (agitated) These emotions have grown more difficult to control. My usual techniques for suppressing them 
          haven't been effective. <br/>
          PHLOX: On Earth, there is a cautionary tale about the dangers of releasing a magical creature called a 
          genie from the bottle. Once it's out, it's extremely difficult to put back in. <br/>
          T'POL: Are you saying these emotions may never subside? <br/>
          PHLOX: You used trellium for three months. It caused significant damage to your neural pathways. You 
          may have to learn to live with these emotions.
