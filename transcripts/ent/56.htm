DEGRA: Nearly all of it. Three of my researchers were killed. <br/>
REPTILIAN: And what of your work, Degra? <br/>
DEGRA: I haven't been able to assess how much data was lost. This will
obviously delay us. <br/>
INSECTOID: How long? <br/>
DEGRA: Months perhaps. I'm not certain.<br/>
INSECTOID: The humans have been through our space! <br/>
REPTILIAN: They attacked a trellium mine. We cannot wait any longer. <br/>
DEGRA: Think what you're asking me to do. Build a weapon to destroy an
entire world. Do you understand how difficult, how dangerous this
project is? <br/>
REPTILIAN: Are you saying you're not up to the task? <br/>
AQUATIC: Dissension will solve nothing. We knew there could be
setbacks. <br/>
ARBOREAL: I agree. We are too far along to change our plan. <br/>
HUMANOID: Besides, we have no alternative. <br/>
REPTILIAN: You know that isn't true. <br/>
HUMANOID: That option has been discussed and rejected. <br/>
INSECTOID: Not by all of us. <br/>
REPTILIAN: Perhaps it is time to reconsider our colleagues' proposal. <br/>
HUMANOID: We do not have enough information about the humans! <br/>
REPTILIAN: That can be remedied. <br/>
AQUATIC: It's too dangerous. <br/>
ARBOREAL: I agree. Degra deserves more time. <br/>
AQUATIC: But if we do not see some progress soon, we'll have no choice
but to consider all our options. </font></p>

T'POL: Is there a problem? <br/>
TUCKER: No. No, no, I mean, this feels great, and I really appreciate
you taking the time. It's just, I'm not sure we should be doing it
anymore. <br/>
T'POL: You said this was helping you sleep. <br/>
TUCKER: It has. <br/>
T'POL: Then why do you want to stop? <br/>
TUCKER: People are talking. About us. About me coming to your quarters
at night. They think there's more going on than neuro-pressure. <br/>
T'POL: And that disturbs you. <br/>
TUCKER: It shouldn't, I know, but Malcolm and I were purging a clogged
injector assembly only last week and he asked me why I didn't just
massage it with my magic fingers. <br/>
T'POL: I see no reason to be concerned with idle gossip. <br/>
TUCKER: It doesn't bother you? <br/>
T'POL: We're both senior officers. If we were pursuing a romantic
relationship it wouldn't be Lieutenant Reed's concern, would it? <br/>
TUCKER: I suppose not. <br/>

ARCHER: The itching kept me up all night. <br/>
PHLOX: Have you been using the ointment I gave you? <br/>
ARCHER: I tried, but the smell is a little strong. <br/>
PHLOX: The more you scratch, the longer it will take to heal. I
understand you may have found a source of trellium-D? <br/>
ARCHER: A V'radian chemist we met at the deuterium station claims he
knows a way to synthesis it. <br/>
PHLOX: I hope he's correct. Crewman Cutler broke her arm when one of
those spatial anomalies went through the Exo-biology lab. The sooner
the ship is insulated against these phenomena the happier I will be. <br/>
ARCHER: We're working on it, Doctor.<br/>
PHLOX: Of course. <br/>(Phlox holds out a jar of ointment. Archer applies it
reluctantly.) <br/>PHLOX: Have you had any other symptoms? <br/>

ALIEN: I don't recognise your species. You
must be newcomers. Welcome. <br/>
ARCHER: Thank you. We're looking for barge twelve, a chemist named
B'Rat Ud. <br/>
ALIEN: It would be a shame if I let you leave our world without
introducing you to the local wildlife. <br/>
ARCHER: That's not necessary. <br/>
ALIEN: Zentho marmots make wonderful pets, and the flesh is quite
succulent when prepared properly. <br/>
ARCHER: No, thank you. Can you direct us to the chemist? <br/>
ALIEN: Barge twelve is that way. Tier two. </font></p>

ARCHER: I have an appointment. We met at the deuterium station on
Norellus.<br/>
B'RAT UD: You'll have to come back later. <br/>
ARCHER: You said you could sell us the formula to synthesise
trellium-D. I hope you didn't bring us all this way for nothing. <br/>
B'RAT UD: Captain Archer? I remember now. How are you? <br/>
ARCHER: A little pressed for time. <br/>
B'RAT UD: Of course. Trellium-A is extremely common, easy to
synthesise, but trellium-D is rare, difficult to process. <br/>
TUCKER: And expensive? <br/>
B'RAT UD: I'm confident we can agree on a fair price. I was thinking
about you recently, Captain. You were very eager to learn about the
Xindi, as I recall. What is your interest in them? <br/>
ARCHER: We're on a diplomatic mission. <br/>
B'RAT UD: A diplomatic mission. Some Xindi arrived here last week. I
thought you might be interested. <br/>
REED: Where can we find them? <br/>
B'RAT UD: They had business with another merchant. <br/>
ARCHER: Who? <br/>
B'RAT UD: I'd be happy to direct you, for a small fee. <br/>
ARCHER: Commander Tucker has the list of supplies and equipment we'd be
willing to barter. As a gesture of good faith, why don't you tell me
where we can find this merchant, then you and Mister Tucker can work
out the details. <br/>

question, I regret I cannot offer free samples. <br/>
ARCHER: B'Rat Ud said you might be able to help us. <br/>
ZJOD: I always welcome referrals. What is your pleasure? <br/>
ARCHER: We were told you've recently done business with some Xindi. <br/>
ZJOD: Excellent customers. They purchased two U'tani serpent women. I'm
afraid I don't have any more, but perhaps I could interest you in a
Nuvian concubine? She's quite skilled. <br/>
ARCHER: We're not interested. I want to know where we can find these
Xindi. <br/>
ZJOD: I believe they left orbit two days ago. <br/>
ARCHER: Where were they heading? <br/>
ZJOD: I wouldn't stay in business very long if I revealed confidential
information about my clients, but I have females here from many worlds.
Who knows, perhaps one of them can tell you what you want to know about
the Xindi.<br/>
(Archer looks around, starts to move away, then stops and turns to look
at a blonde woman in white.)<br/>
ZJOD: You have an excellent eye, my friend. She can be very
accommodating. <br/>

TUCKER [OC}: Captain, B'Rat and I have agreed on a price. I'll need to
go back to the ship for his payment. <br/>

leave.) <br/>

own another person. You're free to go wherever you'd like. How far is
your home world? <br/>
RAJIIN: I don't know. I'm told it's called Oran'taku, but I don't
remember it. <br/>
ARCHER: Do you have any family? <br/>
RAJIIN: I've had many owners. <br/>

openings, then sneezes happily.) <br/>
B'RAT UD: What's this one called? <br/>
TUCKER: Black pepper. There's paprika, mustard seed. I'm partial to the
cayenne myself. I'm sure you'll find these all very exotic. <br/>
REED: I believe you have something for us? <br/>
B'RAT UD: Of course. I've reviewed your engineering specifications. You
appear to have the necessary equipment to produce liquid trellium-D. <br/>
REED: Liquid? <br/>
B'RAT UD: Trellium can only be synthesised in a liquid state. It's just
as effective as the natural ore. <br/>
TUCKER: Then all we need is the recipe. <br/>
B'RAT UD: There is one thing. Be sure to follow the protocols
precisely. <br/>
TUCKER: Or? <br/>
B'RAT UD: Let's just say that in it's liquid form, trellium-D is
extremely unstable. <br/>(B'rat hands over the PADD and carries on sampling the
peppers.) </font></p>

RAJIIN: Much better than I'm used to. The last ship I was on, I never
left the cargo hold. Except for a few visits to the Captain's quarters.

ARCHER: There are some restricted areas on Enterprise, otherwise feel
free to look around. <br/>
RAJIIN: Your crew won't mind? <br/>
ARCHER: I seriously doubt it. <br/>
RAJIIN: Are they all from Earth? <br/>
ARCHER: Nearly all. You've met Doctor Phlox, he's from Denobula. My
first officer's a Vulcan. <br/>
RAJIIN: Doctor Phlox mentioned you were on an important mission. <br/>
ARCHER: We're trying to make contact with a species called Xindi. I
don't suppose you know anything about them? <br/>
RAJIIN: Very little. The two I saw looked reptilian, and they weren't
very pleasant. At the time, I was just relieved they weren't interested
in me. Why are you looking for them? <br/>

TUCKER: Enough to do some serious damage if we screw this up. <br/>
ARCHER: And we're supposed to insulate the entire ship with it? <br/>
TUCKER: It's only volatile in it's liquid form. Once we apply it to the
inner hull and it sets, it's completely safe. The tricky part's cooking
it up in the first place. <br/>
T'POL: It'll require extremely precise calculations but I believe
Mister Tucker and I can synthesise the compound safely. <br/>

PHLOX: I have to finish treating her injuries first. <br/>
ARCHER: How long? <br/>
PHLOX: A few hours. <br/>
(T'Pol slides into the Imaging Chamber.)<br/>
ARCHER: Have Phlox take a look at your head. </font></p>

trying to contact? <br/>
RAJIIN: I'm sorry. <br/>
ARCHER: I asked you a question. <br/>
RAJIIN: I can't answer it. <br/>
ARCHER: What did you do to T'Pol? <br/>
RAJIIN: She shouldn't have resisted. <br/>
ARCHER: (enters cell) Who are you? <br/>
RAJIIN: I told you. My name is Rajiin. <br/>
ARCHER: That's right. Kidnapped when you were a child, sold into a life
of slavery, and it was just a coincidence that you happened to escape
when I was at that market. The chemist knew I was looking for
information about the Xindi. Is that why you showed up so conveniently?
<br/>
RAJIIN: The only thing I can tell you is that you're in danger. <br/>
ARCHER: Care to be a little more specific? <br/>
RAJIIN: If I say anything else, they'll kill me. <br/>
ARCHER: Who, the Xindi? How do you know I won't do the same? <br/>
RAJIIN: It's true that I deceived you, but that didn't make your
decision to help me any less admirable. I don't want to see you harmed,
Captain. The best thing for you to do is let me go. <br/>
ARCHER: Tell me who you contacted. Who! <br/>
REED [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer. <br/>
ARCHER: Go ahead. <br/>
REED [OC]: Two vessels are approaching from aft. Sir, </font></p>

RAJIIN: They won't harm anyone if you let me go. <br/>
ARCHER: Forgive me if I don't take your word on that, but they murdered
seven million people on my planet! <br/>
REED [OC]: Bridge to the Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: Go ahead. <br/>
REED [OC]: The smaller ship is approaching the starboard docking port. <br/>
ARCHER: Seal that airlock and post security teams. I'm on my way.
<br/>(He closes the Brig door.) <br/>ARCHER: What was your mission? <br/>
RAJIIN: They wanted information. <br/>
ARCHER: About what? <br/>
RAJIIN: About you. They're building a weapon. <br/>
ARCHER: We know that. <br/>
RAJIIN: This is different. A bio-weapon. <br/>
ARCHER: Go on. <br/>
RAJIIN: They need data about your species before they can begin. <br/>
ARCHER: Where are they building the weapon? <br/>
RAJIIN: I don't know. <br/>
ARCHER: When will it be ready? <br/>
RAJIIN: I don't know. They didn't tell me anything else. <br/>
ARCHER: (to guard) Get a security detail down here. No one's taking her
anywhere. </font></p>

You're with me. <br/>
(Reed's group meet an insectoid, who shoots Austin and leaves a
grenade. The Reptilians make it to the Brig. Phase pistols have no effect on
them. They fire a green globule onto a bulkhead which then fires lots
of little things at the security guards, taking them out, then they free
Rajiin. Archer and his MACO are in their way and get jumped. He sees
her leaving before his attacker is taken out.) <br/>
ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge. <br/>
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead. <br/>

enhancement. <br/>
ARCHER: I want a complete autopsy, Doctor, and have Malcolm take this
weapon apart. I want to find out it's range, power output and how we
can defend against it. <br/>
TUCKER: Aye sir. <br/>(He leaves with the rifle.) <br/>
ARCHER: Are you okay? <br/>
T'POL: Yes. <br/>
ARCHER: Good, because I want an analysis of the scans we took of those
Xindi ships, and find out what you can about that vortex they went

construct the bio-weapon. <br/>

them!<br/>
(Rajiin goes to the table and leans on it. A projection of a human, with
various organs, appears.) <br/>REPTILIAN: We couldn't pursue the bio-weapon
because we didn't have enough information about the humans. Now we do. <br/>
AQUATIC: We must proceed on both fronts. <br/>
HUMANOID: Do you expect us to reward you for this act of
insubordination? This has left us more vulnerable that we were before. <br/>
