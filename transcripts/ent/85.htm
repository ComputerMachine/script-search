<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">V'LAS: The Andorians have deployed most of their
fleet in defensive positions around Paan Mokar. <br/>
KUVAK: We gave them that planet when we signed the treaty. Why would
they move their forces there? <br/>
V'LAS: They believe we're preparing to retake it. We've been using
unmanned probes to generate false warp signatures in that system. <br/>
KUVAK: Why weren't we informed of this? <br/>
V'LAS: It's possible that Andorian agents have penetrated the High
Command. It's necessary to limit access to this information. Our forces
are actually stationed here, preparing to launch an invasion of
Andoria. <br/>
KUVAK: There are members of the Council who are not convinced an
invasion is necessary at this time. <br/>
V'LAS: We know they have the Xindi technology. You've all seen the
data. <br/>
KUVAK: Data can be falsified. <br/>
V'LAS: We received this sensor telemetry two days ago. It was recorded
by the Andorian ship that stole the Xindi prototype. <br/>(The desk screen shows a small moon being blasted to pieces by a weapon
- the proving ground test from last season.) <br/>
Our operatives tell us the prototype was taken back to Andoria, where
it was disassembled. We have reason to believe the Imperial Guard plans
to equip their vessels with similar weaponry. <br/>
KUVAK: Do you have evidence of this? <br/>
V'LAS: They didn't steal the prototype because they were merely
curious. I'm certain of one thing. Sooner or later, the Andorians will
make use of this technology. Is it logical for us to wait for that day?

care for the wounded. <br/>
ARCHER: How far to the capital? <br/>
T'PAU: Two days. <br/>
T'POL: We need to get back to Enterprise. Tell Starfleet what we've
learned about the embassy bombing. <br/>
ARCHER: We have a more important mission. We've to get this to the
capital. <br/>
T'POL: I don't understand. <br/>
T'PAU: The Kir'Shara contains Surak's original writings. It's the only
surviving record of his true teachings.
It would have an enormous impact on the High Command, and all of
Vulcan. </font></p>

launchers should be online in a few hours. <br/>
TUCKER: Anything else? <br/>
REED: Permission to speak freely? Admiral Gardner ordered us to return
to Earth, yet we've set a course for Andorian territory. <br/>
TUCKER: We are going back. We're just taking a small detour first. <br/>
REED: Have you told Starfleet you're planning to warn the Andorians? <br/>
TUCKER: No. <br/>
REED: Have you any idea what the Admiral will do when he finds out? <br/>
TUCKER: I'll save you a seat at my court-martial. Is there anything
else? <br/>
REED: The Vulcans have legitimate reasons for launching this strike. If
we alert the Andorians, we will be betraying our closest ally. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm trying to prevent a war, Malcolm. A war that Earth could
get draw into. <br/>

TUCKER: Dismissed. <br/>
(Reed leaves, after giving Soval a close glare.) <br/>
SOVAL: You asked for me, Commander? <br/>
TUCKER: I've been thinking. There's no guarantee the Imperial Guard's
going to believe us. We've got no evidence your people are planning
this attack. But there is one Andorian who might trust us. At least he
does some of the time. <br/>
SOVAL: Commander Shran. <br/>
TUCKER: Problem is, I have no idea how to find him. <br/>
SOVAL: I may be able to help. <br/>
TUCKER: Good. <br/>
SOVAL: Lieutenant Reed appeared unsettled. <br/>
TUCKER: Some of the crew are wondering if I'm doing the right thing.
Can't say I blame them. I'm not so sure myself. <br/>

action. <br/>

ARCHER: It's too dangerous. We're staying together. <br/>
T'POL: Taking the artefact to the High Command will accomplish nothing.
<br/>
ARCHER: It might be the only thing that can stop the war. <br/>
T'POL: What war? <br/>
ARCHER: Between Vulcan and Andoria. <br/>
T'POL: We settled our dispute with the Andorians nearly two years ago. <br/>
ARCHER: V'Las was just stalling for time. He's been preparing a
large-scale attack ever since. <br/>
T'POL: Where did you get this information? <br/>
ARCHER: Where do you think? <br/>
T'POL: Assuming for the moment you possess Surak's katra, he's been
dead for centuries. How could he be aware of plans for a war? <br/>
ARCHER: Some of Syrran's memories must have been transferred in the
meld. <br/>
T'POL: Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: You think I've lost my mind? <br/>
T'POL: I'm not certain your mind is the one making these decisions. We
should return to the ship. T'Pau can take the artefact to the capital. <br/>
ARCHER: I was chosen for this. <br/>
T'POL: Chosen? Interesting choice of words. <br/>
ARCHER: If I were in your shoes, I'd be just as sceptical. I'm not
possessed, and I'm not delusional. There are forces at work on your
world right now, trying to undo everything Surak taught your people. If
we fail, Vulcan will be consumed by them. That's why have to get this
thing to the capital. And I'm going to need all three of us to try and

Syrrannites from the sanctuary. <br/>
V'LAS: Was Syrran among them? <br/>
KUVAK: No. He is dead. The Syrrannites say that there were three other
survivors, including a human. <br/>
V'LAS: Archer. <br/>
KUVAK: They say that he is carrying the Kir'Shara. <br/>
V'LAS: The Kir'Shara never existed. <br/>
KUVAK: There are scholars who believe it does, and that it was hidden
in the Forge. The Syrrannites claim that they are following the true
path of Surak. If the Kir'Shara is real, it could prove them right. <br/>
V'LAS: It doesn't exist! You've been listening to Syrrannite
propaganda. That will be all, Minister. <br/>
(Kuvak storms off.) <br/>
V'LAS: Sublieutenant, order Major Talok to find the remaining
Syrrannites. We're dealing with radical insurgents. They're to be

TUCKER: To who? <br/>
SOVAL: The nebula. This is Ambassador Soval. I've come on an urgent
mission. I must speak with Commander Shran. The High Command has
decrypted your security protocols. We're well aware that your task
force has been hiding in this nebula. <br/>
TUCKER: Maybe your information's out of date. <br/>
SOVAL: He's in there. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SHRAN: An invasion? <br/>
SOVAL: That's correct. <br/>
SHRAN: We keep a very close eye on your fleet. We would know if the
High Command were preparing to attack. <br/>
SOVAL: V'Las has been assembling ships near Regulus, beyond the range
of your listening stations. <br/>
SHRAN: Your leaders may be fools, but they're not suicidal. They know
we will respond. <br/>
SOVAL: They were told you're adapting Xindi weaponry and that you're
planning to use it against Vulcan. <br/>
SHRAN: That's absurd! Captain Archer destroyed the Xindi prototype
before we could examine it. <br/>
SOVAL: That fact was conveniently omitted. <br/>
SHRAN: You people are so used to lying, you don't even tell the truth
to each other. How do I know you weren't sent here as a diversion? <br/>
SOVAL: You don't. <br/>
SHRAN: Do you have any idea what will happen when the Imperial Guard
retaliates? It will be a disaster for both our worlds. <br/>
SOVAL: Which is why you must convince them to intercept our fleet. <br/>
SHRAN: You're betraying your own people by telling me this. <br/>
SOVAL: I'm aware of that. <br/>
SHRAN: Why are you doing it? <br/>
SOVAL: The High Command is counting on the element of surprise. If they
meet resistance, I believe V'Las will be forced to call off the
invasion. <br/>
SHRAN: When does this invasion begin? <br/>
SOVAL: Soon. <br/>

grid around the capital. It's unlikely we'll get past it. <br/>
T'PAU: We'll find a way. Surak will help us. You don't believe in the
katra? <br/>
T'POL: It's irrelevant what I believe. The Captain could be permanently
injured if we don't get him to a doctor soon. <br/>
T'PAU: He doesn't need a physician, he needs a priest. One experienced
with katras. <br/>
T'POL: It's irrational that we're following someone in his state of
mind. What if he dies before we can get help? I apologise. My mother's
death has affected me more than I realised. <br/>
T'PAU: It was a great loss. We disagreed frequently, but I valued her
counsel. I could allow you to experience what she shared with me. <br/>
T'POL: You melded with her? I cannot meld. <br/>
T'PAU: I would initiate it. <br/>
T'POL: That's not what I mean. I was forced to participate in a meld
several years ago. I was infected with a neural disease. <br/>
T'PAU: Pa'nar Syndrome. Do you still suffer from it? <br/>
T'POL: There's no cure. <br/>
T'PAU: Another lie perpetrated by the High Command. Pa'nar has been
known since Surak's time. It's caused by melders who have been
improperly trained. One with great experience can correct the
neurological imbalance. <br/>
T'POL: Is there something you can do? <br/>

You didn't expect the Imperial Guard to mobilise its entire fleet based

Our mental disciplines allow us to suppress pain. <br/>

extracting information from Vulcan operatives. This machine doesn't
cause physical discomfort. It uses a neuro-synaptic field to lower your
emotional threshold. <br/>

device. They were never the same again. I have no desire to see that
happen to you. Where is your fleet?! <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ANDORIAN [OC]: Bridge to Commander Shran. <br/>
SHRAN: What is it? <br/>
ANDORIAN [OC]: The General is asking for an update on the
interrogation. <br/>
SHRAN: Tell him I'll contact him when I'm ready. <br/>
ANDORIAN [OC]: Acknowledged. <br/>
SHRAN: You find this amusing? <br/>
SOVAL: Ordinarily, I wouldn't, but because of this device <br/>
SHRAN: There are three higher settings on that panel. If I use them <br/>
SOVAL: You're afraid to injure me. If I were you, I'd leave that detail
out of your report to the General. <br/>
SHRAN: Where is your fleet? <br/>
SOVAL: I was a fool to think you'd listen. Perhaps the High Command was
right. We'll be better off when Andoria falls. <br/>
(The ship is hit by weapons fire.) <br/>
SHRAN: Report! <br/>
ANDORIAN [OC]: It's the Starfleet ship. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REED: Direct hit to their shield generator. <br/>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ANDORIAN [OC]: Should we return fire? <br/>
SOVAL: Are you going to make enemies of the humans as well? <br/>
SHRAN: Lieutenant, order our ships out of the nebula. <br/>
ANDORIAN [OC]: Commander? <br/>
SHRAN: And tell Enterprise we'll be returning the Ambassador shortly. <br/>
ANDORIAN [OC]: Understood. <br/>
SHRAN: Get that thing off of him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Vulcan - day]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They've found the tracks of boots in the sand.) <br/>
T'PAU: They're heading east. Away from the capital. She's with them.
Where are you going? <br/>
ARCHER: To find my science officer. And I don't want to hear any
lectures about the needs of the many. I get enough of that crap from,
from T'Pol. <br/>
T'PAU: There's no logic to your plan. We have no weapons. If they take
the Kir'Shara from you, they'll destroy it. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm going to find her. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SHRAN: How is he? <br/>
TUCKER: You've got a lot of nerve pretending you give a damn. <br/>
SHRAN: I did what was necessary. Soval would understand. <br/>
PHLOX: He should be fine in another day or so. <br/>
TUCKER: He risked his life coming here, and you paid him back by
scrambling his neurons. <br/>
SHRAN: He's not the only one taking a risk. I just spoke with the
Imperial Guard. They're re-deploying our forces. <br/>
TUCKER: Now you believe him. What changed your mind? <br/>
SHRAN: A lesser man would've told me what I wanted to hear, even if it
wasn't true. There's been too much suspicion, too many lies, on both
sides. Our fleet will intercept the Vulcans at these coordinates. My
superiors believe it may be helpful if Enterprise were to join us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Vulcan]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(An animal screech rings out.) <br/>
TALOK: Sehlat. <br/>
(He sends his men through the rock formations, but we see it's actually
T'Pau imitating a sehlat, and she's lured them to a gallicite deposit.
With the two Vulcans out cold, Archer deals with Talok himself.) <br/>
ARCHER: My First Officer, where is she? What have you done with her? <br/>
TALOK: She's been taken to the High Command. <br/>
(Archer neck-pinches him into unconsciousness.) <br/>
T'PAU: Your technique has improved. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[High Command]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">V'LAS: Welcome home, Subcommander. <br/>
T'POL: I no longer hold that rank. <br/>
V'LAS: Well, you may have joined Starfleet, but you're still Vulcan.
And subject to our laws. There are few crimes still punishable by
execution, but treason is one of them. <br/>(A beeping sound.) <br/>V'LAS: What is it? <br/>
KUVAK: Seven alien ships have taken position outside the Andorian
system. They are directly in the path of our fleet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REED: Are you sure this is wise? If the Vulcans
find us here, they might think we're siding with the Andorians. There's
no guarantee they won't fire on us. <br/>
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm reading a massive subspace distortion. <br/>
TUCKER: Hoshi? <br/>
HOSHI: It's the Vulcans. They'll be here in two hours. He's hailing us
again. <br/>
TUCKER: On screen. <br/>
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Our sensors show twelve Vulcan cruisers
approaching. <br/>
TUCKER: When will the rest of your fleet get here? <br/>
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: They won't arrive in time. We're on our own. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Vulcan]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They reach the top of a rocky ridge overlooking
the capital city.) <br/>
ARCHER: I'm still not clear how the Kir'Shara's gonna stop a war. <br/>
T'PAU: V'Las can't govern without approval from the Council. The
existence of the Kir'Shara will persuade them to reconsider their
support. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't suppose they'll let us just walk into the High Command.
<br/>
T'PAU: We can transport in, but we'll need access codes. <br/>
ARCHER: I know someone who might have them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Vulcan cruisers have just dropped out of warp.)
<br/>
REED: The Vulcans are powering weapons. The Andorians are doing the
same. <br/>
TUCKER: Travis, put us between both fleets. If the Vulcans want to
start a war, they're going to have to get through us first. <br/>
HOSHI: It's Shran. <br/>
SHRAN [OC]: Commander, what do you think you're doing? <br/>
TUCKER: In case you hadn't noticed they outnumber us two to one. <br/>
SHRAN [OC]: Get back in formation! <br/>
TUCKER: I'm trying to buy us some time! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They are watching the ship movements on the
tabletop display.) <br/>
KUVAK: The Andorians have more ships on the way. <br/>
V'LAS: They won't arrive for several hours. <br/>
KUVAK: You told us this strike would be a surprise. That there would be
minimal casualties on both sides. The Andorians are armed with standard
particle cannons. There is no evidence of Xindi technology.
Administrator, we have to call off this attack. <br/>
V'LAS: Our forces are committed. We can't turn back. <br/>
VULCAN [OC]: We're being hailed by the Starfleet ship. <br/>
TUCKER [OC]: This is Commander Tucker. Sorry to spoil your surprise,
but the Andorians know what you're planning. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TUCKER: I suggest you turn your ships around now. <br/>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">V'LAS: If you side with the Andorians, you'll be
fired upon. <br/>

is destroyed, Starfleet's going to know who is responsible. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Vlas ends the transmission.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

REED: No, just the Andorians. <br/>
TUCKER: Stand by phase-cannons. Don't fire until I give the order. <br/>
(The Vulcans open fire, and the Andorians return it, accidentally
hitting Enterprise.) <br/>

KUVAK: Stay where you are. <br/>
ARCHER: We need to have a talk. <br/>
T'PAU: Administrator, it is agreeable to see you again. <br/>
V'LAS: This woman is an anarchist, Captain. Whatever she's told you
isn't the truth. <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pau didn't bomb our embassy. You did. <br/>
V'LAS: The evidence is conclusive. <br/>
ARCHER: Evidence your people gave us. The bombing was an excuse to
round up the Syrrannites, make certain they'd never find this. <br/>
(He places the elegant pyramid on the table.) <br/>
KUVAK: Is that? <br/>(T'Pau nods.) <br/>
V'LAS: The Kir'Shara's a myth! <br/>
(Archer presses the correct places on each of the three sides, and the
Kir'Shara projects Surak's writings as a hologram around the room.) </font></p>

V'LAS: You can't trust her! She'd do anything to spread her deviant

T'PAU: The Kir'Shara will show us our true path. <br/>

promised your family that we would eventually live together. <br/>

Vulcan, but for Earth as well. <br/>
SOVAL; The Minister intends to pursue a less aggressive policy toward
your people. The High Command will be dissolved. <br/>
