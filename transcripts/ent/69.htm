to be the crew's offspring. <br/>
ARCHER: A hatchery? <br/>
TUCKER: They built this place to take quite a beating. Reinforced
bulkheads, back-up power systems. <br/>
T'POL: Thirty one eggs are still viable. <br/>
TUCKER: They won't survive for long. The bio-support's losing power. <br/>
ARCHER: Do you think you can repair it? <br/>
TUCKER: I wouldn't even know where to start. <br/>
ARCHER: There's a shuttlecraft in their port bay. Get it back to the

him.) <br/>
PHLOX: A mild neurotoxin. Likely part of an autonomic defence system.
The egg probably considered you a threat. <br/>
ARCHER: Humans seem to have that effect on the Xindi. <br/>
PHLOX: An analgesic should take care of the irritation. <br/>
ARCHER: Malcolm's bringing you two dead insectoids. I want you to learn
as much as you can about them. <br/>
PHLOX: Understood. <br/>
T'POL: We've located their Armoury. We found several particle weapons
and torpedo casings. <br/>
ARCHER: What about the data you recovered? <br/>
T'POL: Ensign Sato's translating it. We'll be ready to leave orbit as
soon as the Xindi shuttle's aboard. </font></p>

draws his weapon.) <br/>
REED: Do you intent do shoot me, Major? <br/>
HAYES: It's not you I'm worried about. I've been going over the results
from the last training session. Your senior officers have shown a lot
of improvement, but I think they can do better. With your permission
I'd like to schedule some more target practice for Monday evening. <br/>
REED: That won't go over well with Commander Tucker. Monday night is
movie night. <br/>
HAYES: Maybe he can sacrifice some leisure time for the sake of this
mission. <br/>
REED: The senior officers do have other duties. We can't all spend our
time playing holographic games in the Armoury. <br/>

(T'Pol and Tucker enter.) <br/>
TUCKER: I think we figured out what happened to them. One of the
nacelles fractured when they were coming out of a subspace vortex. They
probably tried to make an emergency landing on this planet. <br/>
ARCHER: According to Phlox, the insectoids we found weren't killed in
the crash, they suffocated? <br/>
T'POL: Most of the crew appear to have died when they transferred their
life-support to the hatchery. <br/>
ARCHER: They sacrificed themselves to save their children. You said the
hatchery's losing biosupport. How long will it last? <br/>
TUCKER: Another day, at most. <br/>
ARCHER: I want you to assign a team to repair it. <br/>
TUCKER: Captain? <br/>
T'POL: What about Azati Prime? <br/>
ARCHER: It's not going anywhere. This is a sentient species. We can't
abandon them. <br/>
TUCKER: Captain, with all due respect, why the hell not? I've got half
a mind to take a plasma torch to that place. <br/>
ARCHER: What if we found a nursery filled with thirty one infant
primates. Would you want to torch them? The Xindi are trying to destroy
Earth because they heard that humans are ruthless. This is a chance to
prove them wrong. <br/>
T'POL: We can bring the eggs aboard, reconfigure one of the cargo bays.
<br/>
ARCHER: I already talked to Phlox. He says they're integrated into the
hatchery walls. If we remove them, they'll die. <br/>
TUCKER: Sir, this is crazy. These people are trying to kill us. <br/>
ARCHER: This isn't open for discussion. I'll lead the engineering team.
I need you up here to help Travis figure out how to operate that Xindi
shuttle. <br/>

ARCHER: I've made my decision. Get to work. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TUCKER: They may know how to make a weapon, but
these people could learn a thing or two about designing a comfortable
chair. <br/>
TRAVIS: For an Insectoid, maybe they are comfortable. <br/>
TUCKER: And the power grid doesn't make much sense. Almost half of it's
routed to structural integrity. <br/>
TRAVIS: You could probably fly this thing inside a gas giant. <br/>
TUCKER: Assuming you could figure out how to fly it. <br/>
TRAVIS: This icon looks like it might represent the impulse manifolds. <br/>
TUCKER: Give it a shot. <br/>(There's an Insectoid warning then the lights
go out.) <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> REED: (using PADD) You're going to have to remove
the relays here and here. That should disable the security protocols. <br/>
TUCKER: We can't initialise the engines without them. <br/>
TRAVIS: What about the ship on the surface? We might be able to salvage
what we need. <br/>
TUCKER: Yeah. <br/>
REED: Any word on how much longer he's planning to stay in orbit? <br/>
TUCKER: The repairs are moving slow. <br/>
REED: I'd be the last to question the Captain's orders, but doesn't it
seem a little odd that we're staying here to save a nest of Xindi? <br/>
TUCKER: The Captain thinks it's the right thing to do. We may be at
war, but these creatures need our help. <br/>
REED: Meanwhile, their big brothers are trying to destroy Earth. <br/>
TRAVIS: Every day we stay here gives them more time to finish their
weapon. <br/>
TUCKER: Look, there's a chance we'll run into more insectoids when we
reach that red giant. Spending an extra day or two studying their
tactical systems might be useful. </font></p>

PHLOX: Ah, Captain. I've learnt quite a bit about this fascinating
fellow. Perhaps fellow is the wrong word. Their species is genderless. <br/>
ARCHER: Then who made all those eggs? <br/>
PHLOX: They reproduce asexually. Each adult appears capable of
producing multiple egg sacs. I wouldn't be surprised if every insectoid
vessel had it's own hatchery. I'd estimate their lifespan is no more
than twelve Earth years. This individual may be one of the elder
members of the crew. It was nearly ten years old. <br/>
ARCHER: What about the hatchery? When will the eggs mature? <br/>
PHLOX: Without knowing more about their incubation cycle it's
impossible to say, but probably no more than a week at most. Captain,
if you don't mind my saying, you look as if you could use some rest. <br/>

ARCHER: Later. Are we ready? <br/>
TUCKER: Just a few seconds, Captain. <br/>
T'POL: There are two MACOs posted outside. <br/>
ARCHER: I asked Major Hayes to assign them. These eggs are vulnerable.
There are breaches in the outer hull. There could be predators around. <br/>
T'POL: Aside from microbes, we found no evidence of life on this
planet. <br/>
ARCHER: Trip. <br/>
TUCKER: We're ready. Start at forty megajoules, but keep an eye on that
matrix converter. Take it up to fifty. <br/>(Systems start to light up, then
something goes bang.)<br/>
ARCHER: Trip. <br/>(An egg sac explodes and an engineer goes flying.) <br/>ARCHER: Shut it

REED: Why so much? <br/>
TUCKER: Every system on that ship is integrated. The only way to bring
biosupport back online is to power up the whole thing. <br/>
REED: That's not going to leave much antimatter for our torpedoes,
never mind our engines. <br/>
T'POL: Did you inform the Captain? <br/>
TUCKER: I wanted to run it by both of you first. <br/>
REED: I never imagined Captain Archer would put the welfare of a few
Xindi before his own people. Do you know, he spent nearly two days in
that hatchery. From what I'm told, he hasn't stopped working long
enough to even sleep! <br/>

ARCHER: Where's Trip? Did you bring the antimatter? <br/>
T'POL: No. <br/>
ARCHER: What's the problem? <br/>
T'POL: Initialising their reactor will deplete our reserves by over one
third. <br/>
ARCHER: We can spare it. We're only a few light years from the red
giant. We'll still have more than enough fuel get there. <br/>
T'POL: We don't know for certain if the weapon is in that system. <br/>
ARCHER: There are lives at risk here. <br/>
T'POL: Billions of lives are at risk on Earth if our mission fails. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm well aware of that. These Xindi are innocent. If we let
them die, we'll be proving to the others that they're right about us. I
don't know much about Vulcan ethics, but humans don't throw morality
out the window when things start getting a little rough. <br/>

would compromise our mission. <br/>

start the antimatter transfer. <br/>

Admiral Forrest. <br/>

much time in that hatchery. <br/>
TUCKER: If you're looking for a new first officer, you should consider
Malcolm. You're going to want someone on the Bridge full time, and I'm
a little busy at the moment. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm happy with the command structure the way it is. This is
only temporary. T'Pol just needed a slap on the wrist. <br/>
TUCKER: She's questioned your orders lots of times, but you've never
locked her up before. You have to admit its a little out of the
ordinary. <br/>
ARCHER: These aren't ordinary circumstances. T'Pol refused a direct
order in front of the crew. I can't have senior officers behaving like
that, especially on a mission this important. <br/>
TUCKER: Maybe you ought to confine me to quarters too, sir, because I'm
still not sure we're doing the right thing here. If the roles were
reversed I can't imagine these Xindi would do the same for us. <br/>
ARCHER: My great grandfather was in North Africa during the Eugenics
Wars. His battalion was evacuating civilians from a war zone when they
came under attack. There was a school full of children directly between
them and the enemy. If his men had returned fire, they might have hit
it. So he called the commander on the other side, and got him to agree
to hold his fire long enough to evacuate the school. There are rules,
Trip, even in war. We have to help these children. </font></p>

HAYES: Scenarios like this can tell us a lot about the enemy's tactical
capabilities. Much more that we'd learn from a standard analysis. <br/>
REED: I asked you to look for weaknesses in their shields, not to play
more games. <br/>
HAYES: This isn't exactly a game, Lieutenant. The simulation found that
they're vulnerable here. They've got minimal shielding around their
impulse manifolds. A pair of torpedoes should be enough to take out the
engines. <br/>
REED: Those manifolds are pretty narrow, but our targeting scanners
should be able to get a lock. Nice work. <br/>
HAYES: Thank you, sir. <br/>

HAYES: They certainly are. <br/>

TUCKER: What do you suggest I do, start a mutiny? <br/>
T'POL: You have to speak with Phlox. Ask him to run a full exam on the
Captain. <br/>
TUCKER: What good would that do? <br/>
T'POL: If the Doctor can find something wrong, we may have medical
grounds to relieve him of command. <br/>
TUCKER: Relieve him? Look, I know you're upset about what happened, but
I think you're taking this personally. <br/>
T'POL: How long before the reactor's brought online? <br/>
TUCKER: Assuming Hoshi can translate the interface, about twelve hours.
<br/>
T'POL: You have to delay it until we can verify the Captain's mental
state. <br/>
TUCKER: If he finds out what we're doing, we'll both end up in the
Brig. You're asking me to betray him. <br/>
T'POL: You can't allow your personal feelings for the Captain to affect
your decision. We both know he's endangering this ship and our mission.

TRAVIS: A subspace vortex is opening off the port bow. <br/>
REED: Tactical alert. Captain Archer, report to the Bridge. <br/>
HOSHI: It's an insectoid, three biosigns aboard. <br/>
TRAVIS: They're firing. <br/>(Enterprise rocks to the impact.) <br/>TRAVIS: They're moving
away at full impulse. <br/>
REED: Pursuit course. Arm phase cannons. Disable their engines. <br/>(Two
phase shots are fired.) <br/>
TRAVIS: No effect. <br/>
HOSHI: Their main deflector's charging. They could be trying to open a
vortex. <br/>
REED: Torpedoes. Maximum yield. Target their impulse manifolds. <br/>

REED: Fire. <br/>
(One torpedo misses, the other blows it to pieces just as Archer comes
on deck.) <br/>
ARCHER: What the hell's going on? <br/>
REED: An insectoid ship, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: You destroyed them? <br/>
REED: They were opening a vortex. They would have escaped. <br/>
ARCHER: The crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery. <br/>
REED: Sir? <br/>
ARCHER: We could have kept our antimatter and continued the mission. <br/>
REED: They would have told their superiors, sir. Given away our
position. <br/>
ARCHER: If you'd explained to them why we were here, you might have
avoided a fire fight. <br/>
REED: With all due respect sir, they didn't seem particularly
interested in talking. <br/>
ARCHER: Archer to Major Hayes. <br/>
HAYES [OC]: Go ahead, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: Report to my Ready room, on the double. <br/>
HAYES [OC]: Aye, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm relieving you as Tactical officer. From now on, you'll
report to Major Hayes. <br/>
REED: I did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission. <br/>
ARCHER: You'll be confined to quarters until further notice. <br/>
REED: Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: Dismissed. <br/>
REED: Yes, sir. <br/>(Reed leaves.) <br/>
ARCHER: Are you done with that translation? <br/>
HOSHI: Almost. <br/>
ARCHER: I want you to put together a distress call in the Insectoid
language. Transmit it on all frequencies as soon as you're ready. <br/>
HOSHI: Understood. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ready room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: There's nothing more important than the
success of this mission. Do you agree, Major? <br/>
HAYES: Of course, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: My senior officers don't seem to understand what I'm trying to
do here. I guess I have myself to blame. In the past, I've encouraged
them to ask questions, but we don't have time for that now. I need
officers who respect the chain of command and can follow orders. <br/>
HAYES: It won't be a problem, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: I thought what happened with T'Pol might have been an isolated
incident, but I'm not so sure now. Lieutenant Reed destroyed a ship
that could have helped us. I'm starting to wonder if he deliberately
tried to sabotage this mission. You're in command while I'm on the
surface. You answer to me, and me alone. Is that understood, Major? <br/>

ARCHER: What is it? <br/>
TUCKER: I'd like you to go to Sickbay with Phlox. <br/>
ARCHER: Do I look sick to you? <br/>
TUCKER: Hoshi says you ordered her to transmit a distress call. <br/>
ARCHER: That's right. <br/>
TUCKER: Don't you think that's a little dangerous? <br/>
ARCHER: We'll be light years from here before the Xindi respond to it. <br/>
TUCKER: We don't know how far away their ships are. If we send that
message we'll be taking a hell of a risk. <br/>
ARCHER: We can't afford to play it safe anymore. This mission's too
important. <br/>
TUCKER: This mission is to save Earth, not an alien hatchery. <br/>
PHLOX: Captain, you haven't eaten or slept in almost two days. You've
shown signs of obsessional behaviour and paranoia. <br/>
ARCHER: If it'll make the two of you feel better, I'll go to Sickbay
for a complete physical as soon as that reactor's online. <br/>
TUCKER: That's not good enough, sir. Phlox has the authority to order
you to Sickbay. <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pol's manipulating you, isn't she. If I'm declared unfit for
duty, then she takes over. <br/>
PHLOX: Captain, if you won't come with me then I'll be required under
Starfleet order 104 section C to relieve you of command. <br/>
ARCHER: I expected something like this from her, but not from the two
of you. Corporal. <br/>(A MACO comes from around the corner.) <br/>ARCHER: I've already
confined two senior officers today. <br/>

PHLOX: His neurochemistry appears normal. <br/>
TUCKER: There's nothing wrong with him? <br/>
PHLOX: This scan is hardly conclusive. I'll need to get him into the
imaging chamber and run a complete neurological series. <br/>
TUCKER: When Hoshi sends that distress call, every Xindi ship that
picks it up will start heading this way. He's got Hayes on the Bridge,
MACOs posted all over the ship. Whatever we do, we're going to have to
do it fast. <br/>

I think she caused some nerve damage. <br/>

distracted.) <br/>

T'POL: Is he still on the surface? <br/>
TUCKER: Yeah. <br/>
T'POL: Retrieving him and the antimatter should be the priority. <br/>
REED: I'd advise securing the Bridge first. If Hayes gets wind of this
we could have a fire-fight on our hands. <br/>
PHLOX: Perhaps we should approach the Major and explain the situation.
He seems like a reasonable man. <br/>
REED: That would be risky. If Hayes sides with the Captain, this mutiny
will be over before it begins. <br/>
T'POL: We'll need more people. Who's on duty in the Armoury? <br/>

Tactical who leaves his post, then the Bridge doors open at the side

PHLOX: In his quarters, resting. Do you recall when the Captain was
attacked by one of the eggs? <br/>
HAYES: It sprayed something in his face. <br/>
PHLOX: I thought it was a defence reflex, but it was actually something
far more sophisticated. The substance contained a unique neurochemical.
It infiltrated the Captain's synaptic pathways, causing him to reverse
imprint on the baby insectoids. It's the opposite of what happens when
a young animal bonds with its mother. <br/>
HAYES: Are you saying he thought he was the mother of those things? <br/>
PHLOX: Well, more likely a caretaker. Of course, the Captain didn't
realise this on a conscious level. Eventually he became obsessed with
protecting the eggs to the exclusion of everything else. <br/>
T'POL: Including our mission. <br/>
HAYES: I'd like to speak with him, if you don't mind. <br/>
