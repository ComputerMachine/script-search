went down a few times. <br/>
KEMPER: Only in simulation, sir. <br/>
HAWKINS: Same here, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: This is an alien ship we're boarding. We could run into
magnetic variances. Watch your step. <br/>
ALL: Yes, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: We're looking for anything that could tell us what happened to
them. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ARCHER:
We counted seventeen bodies. Most of them died when their life support
ran out. The others were killed by particle weapons. What's our status?
<br/>
T'POL: Ensign Sato managed to bring the transceiver online, but other
than that. <br/>
ARCHER: Archer to Mayweather. <br/>
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: Resume our previous course, one quarter impulse. <br/>
TRAVIS [OC]: Understood. <br/>
T'POL: It might be best to complete repairs before we head deeper into
the Expanse. If we encounter any more anomalies <br/>
ARCHER: Those people have been dead for less than two days. Whoever
attacked them could still be nearby. We'll have to make repairs on the
move. Mister Reed recovered some data from their Bridge. See what you
can make of it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUCKER:
Let's try it again. Watch that intermix ratio. <br/>(The warp engine starts
to hum.) <br/>TUCKER: Looking good. Bring her up to forty percent. <br/>(Energy arcs flash
out again.) <br/>TUCKER: Shut it down. Shut it down! <br/>
ARCHER: How's it coming? <br/>
TUCKER: Could be better. Creating a stable warp field isn't easy when
the laws of physics won't cooperate. The Cochrane Equation, it's not
constant here. The problem's in the quantum variables. Every time I try
to compensate, the spatial gradients get thrown out of whack. Either we
get away from these anomalies or we're going to have to rewrite the
book on warp theory, and I don't have to tell you how long it took
Zefram Cochrane the first time around. <br/>
ARCHER: What about tactical systems? <br/>
TUCKER: Weapons should be up and running within an hour or two. <br/>
ARCHER: Make them your priority. <br/>
TUCKER: You worried about something? <br/>
ARCHER: Weapons, Trip. As quickly as you can. <br/>(Archer leaves.)<br/>
TUCKER: Now where's Isaac Newton when you need him. <br/>

as the others start shooting at him, he makes the engines arc to keep
the others away. Just as Reed gets there and starts shooting, they beam
away and Trip turns off the engine again. Archer and Hawkins burst into
an completely empty Cargo bay. The alien ship leaves.) </font></p>

Increase his anaprovaline by fifty milligrams. <br/>
ARCHER: How are they? <br/>
PHLOX: Stable. However, they've suffered extensive disruptor burns. I'd
like to start them on regeneration therapy, but the Imaging Chamber was
damaged in the attack. I'll need a repair team as soon as possible. <br/>
ARCHER: Understood. <br/>(Archer pulls back the curtain on a bed with a dead
crewman on it.) <br/>
PHLOX: Crewman Fuller. I did everything I could. <br/>
ARCHER: What about him? <br/>(The alien that Trip knocked out.) <br/>
PHLOX: A few internal injuries. I'll need to keep him under
observation. <br/>
ARCHER: You can observe him in the Brig. See to it. <br/>
KEMPER: Aye sir. <br/>
PHLOX: You might be interested to know that I recognise his species.
He's Osaarian. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ARCHER:
How bad is it? <br/>
TUCKER: They made off with three photonic torpedoes, a case of plasma
rifles, two dozen stun grenades, Chef says they cleaned out half of the
food stores, Cargo Bay two's been stripped to the bulkheads, but that's
not the worst of it. They took every one of our antimatter storage
pods. All we've got left is what's in the main reactor. <br/>
ARCHER: How long will that last, a month? <br/>
TUCKER: Tops. After that we're out of gas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ARCHER:
This is all you've got? <br/>
T'POL: High Command hasn't had much contact with the Osaarians. They
have a large merchant fleet, but there's no record of piracy. <br/>
ARCHER: Any luck tracking their ship? <br/>
T'POL: Not yet. They've found a way to mask their ion trail. <br/>
ARCHER: For a people with no history of piracy, they've gotten pretty
good at it. Keep looking. <br/>
T'POL: It appears they've adapted their weapons and engines to
compensate for the anomalies. Pursuing them will be dangerous. We
should consider other alternatives. <br/>
ARCHER: Such as what? Waiting for our antimatter to run dry? <br/>
T'POL: I'm only suggesting that we may be able to replenish our
supplies elsewhere. <br/>
ARCHER: Keep looking. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ARCHER:
(to guard outside) Open it. <br/>(He goes in and talks to the prisoner through
the intercom.) <br/>ARCHER: Doctor Phlox said your injuries were minor. Please get
up. <br/>
ORGOTH: Why? <br/>
ARCHER: I have a dead crewman. <br/>
ORGOTH: I didn't kill him. <br/>
ARCHER: No, one of your friends did. But I don't have one of your
friends, I have you, so get up and look at me. (he does. His face is
scarred and twisted) Thank you. You're going to help me find your ship,
and after I've taken back what they stole from me, you and your
colleagues are free to go. <br/>
ORGOTH: If you went anywhere near that ship you'd have more than one
dead crewman. I can't help you. Even if I could, my Captain wouldnn't
be very interested in having me back, would he. Not after I told you
where to find him. <br/>
ARCHER: That's a risk you'll have to take, because the alternative is
going to be a lot less pleasant. <br/>
ORGOTH: I don't think you'd be very comfortable torturing another man.
You and your crewmates are far too civilised for that. Too moral. <br/>
ARCHER: I need what was stolen from me. There's too much at stake to
let my morality get in the way. <br/>
ORGOTH: You're obviously new to this Expanse. If you weren't, your
ship's hull would be insulated with trellium-D. Do you have any idea
what a spatial distortion can do to a ship that is not insulated with
trellium-D? What it can do to the people inside that ship? <br/>
ARCHER: You masked your ion trail. How? <br/>
ORGOTH: Well, my Captain's a very clever man. He has to be. When you're
forced to resort to desperate measures in order to survive, you have to
be clever. You need to know how to hide. <br/>
ARCHER: So you were forced into piracy. <br/>
ORGOTH: When we entered this Expanse we were no different than you. Two
merchant ships looking for trade routes. Then the first distortion hit
us. We decided to return home, but the perimeter, the thermobaric
clouds, let you in but they don't let you out. One of our ships was
destroyed trying. After a few more encounters with the anomalies it
wasn't long before we became predators. This section of the Expanse
proved to be ideal for hunting. When a ship runs aground due to spatial
distortions it becomes an easy target. Our Captain told us we wouldn't
harm anyone, and we didn't. Not at first. It takes time to learn to
kill without remorse. You're not prepared to kill, or torture. Not yet.
<br/>
ARCHER: I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to find your ship, and if
that ends up causing me remorse, then it's something I'm willing to
live with. Think about it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Command
centre]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> T'POL:
I've been studying the data
recovered from the derelict. Apparently, they decided to look for the
Osaarians as well. They found a way to modify their sensors to detect
the ion trail. Their life support failed before they had a chance to
start. <br/>
ARCHER: Did they leave a record of the modifications? <br/>
T'POL: I've already given it to Ensign Mayweather. <br/>
ARCHER: What's our tactical situation. <br/>
T'POL: Hull plating's back online. We should have phase cannons within
the hour. <br/>
ARCHER: Torpedoes? <br/>
T'POL: Lieutenant Reed is still having difficulty modifying the
guidance systems to compensate for the anomalies. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll be in the Armoury. </font></p>

is at a table pouring over four PADDs when Reed comes in to get a
drink.) <br/>
REED: Black tea, hot. You finished rewriting the physics books? <br/>
TUCKER: I don't think I'll be taking home a Nobel prize anytime soon. <br/>
REED: A few hours rest might do you a world of good. <br/>
TUCKER: No kidding. <br/>
REED: You still can't sleep? <br/>
TUCKER: T'Pol's been trying to help, showing me how to stimulate my
neural nodes. It's not what you think. <br/>
REED: I wasn't thinking anything. <br/>
TUCKER: How are the weapons coming? <br/>
REED: The Captain and I managed to bring the guidance systems online,
but we're going to need more time for the aft launchers. Fuller knew
those torpedo systems better than anyone. He won't be easy to replace.
Considering all the hostile aliens we've met, I suppose it's fortunate
we haven't lost more people. <br/>
TUCKER: I doubt he'll be the last. <br/>
REED: There's no reason to get cynical. <br/>
TUCKER: Every species we run into seems to be gunning for us. We might
as well paint a giant bulls-eye on the hull. <br/>
REED: What do you suggest we do, turn around and go back to Earth? <br/>
TUCKER: All I'm saying is that this mission, whether it succeeds or
not, is looking like a one-way ticket all the time. </font></p>

Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've been tracking the Osaarians' ion
trail for the past four hours. There's still no sign of them. </font></p>

TRAVIS: Nothing. <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pol? <br/>
T'POL: Curious. The trail resumes after another seventy thousand
kilometres. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's see it. (Hoshi puts a schematic on the viewscreen) <br/>
TRAVIS: Shall I alter course? <br/>
ARCHER: Not yet. Why would there be such a large gap? <br/>
T'POL: Their ions may have been dispersed by stellar winds. <br/>
HOSHI: There would still be some residual particles. <br/>
REED: Captain, the particle decay rates don't match. This one is at
least nine hours old, this one was left less than an hour ago. <br/>
ARCHER: Bring weapons online. Take us to where the first trail ends.
<br/>(As they move on, the ship shakes.) <br/>ARCHER: Travis? <br/>
TRAVIS: I'm not reading anything. <br/>
(The lights flicker, then we see Enterprise vanish as it crosses an
invisible threshold.) <br/>
REED: Power's fluctuating. Forward plating's down. <br/>
T'POL: Microfractures are forming on the outer hull. We should come
about. <br/>
ARCHER: Keep going. <br/>(Flashes, bangs, ripple effects, then the ship
reappears and a spherical structure is seen on the viewscreen.) <br/>ARCHER: T'Pol. <br/>
T'POL: It's approximately nineteen kilometres in diameter. <br/>
ARCHER: Ever seen anything like it? <br/>
T'POL: No. It's constructed entirely of a single alloy. <br/>
REED: Who could build something that big? <br/>
ARCHER: Take us in closer. <br/>
REED: That cloaking field is enormous. Whoever built this thing went to
a great deal of trouble to conceal it. <br/>
ARCHER: Judging from those ion trails, the Osaarians spent over eight
hours here. I want to find out why. Any luck scanning the interior? <br/>
T'POL: Our sensors are being deflected. <br/>
ARCHER: See if you can find something that looks like a way in. Take us
into orbit. <br/>
T'POL: I'm detecting what appears to be a portal, twenty two degrees
north of our current position. <br/>
ARCHER: Put it up. <br/>(A pair of sliding doors come into view.) <br/>ARCHER: Can you
tell what the door's made of? <br/>
T'POL: Polyduranium. The same metal as the Osaarian's hull. <br/>
ARCHER: Can we fit through? <br/>
TRAVIS: Not with Enterprise. <br/>

T'POL: He'll have warp drive online within the next thirty minutes. <br/>
ARCHER: Have the away teams speed it up. I want to go to warp as soon
as they're back. <br/>
T'POL: Quantum scans indicate it's nearly a thousand years old. <br/>
ARCHER: What else? <br/>
T'POL: The structure contains seven fusion reactors. Each one is almost
twelve kilometres long. Only three are still operational. <br/>
ARCHER: Any idea what they were designed for? <br/>
T'POL: The sphere's emitting massive amounts of gravimetric energy. It
may have something to do with the spatial anomalies. <br/>
ARCHER: Take as many scans as you can. <br/>
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer. <br/>
ARCHER: Go ahead. <br/>
HOSHI [OC] Sir, could you come to the Situation Room? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Situation
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> HOSHI:
While I was translating the cargo manifest, something caught my eye.
Look at these markings. I had to double-check, but I was pretty sure
that I had seen this ideography before. This is a piece of the Xindi
probe that crashed on Earth. At least three of the symbols are an exact
match. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ARCHER:
Your ship attacked a Xindi vessel. I want to know everything you can
tell me about them. </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(Orgoth is lying on the bunk.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">
ORGOTH: Xindi? <br/>
ARCHER: You heard me. <br/>
ORGOTH: I don't remember a species with that name. <br/>
ARCHER: You're lying. Your manifest said you took their ship less than
two weeks ago. <br/>
ORGOTH: What manifest? <br/>
ARCHER: Tell me what you know. <br/>
ORGOTH: It was a small ship, they were no match for us. <br/>
ARCHER: Where are they now? <br/>(Orgoth looks at him and snorts
disdainfully.) <br/>ARCHER: You destroyed them? <br/>
ORGOTH: They resisted. We had no choice. <br/>
ARCHER: Where did they come from? <br/>
ORGOTH: I have better things to do than familiarise myself with our
victims. <br/>
ARCHER: Which species of Xindi were they? What did they look like? <br/>
ORGOTH: I don't remember. </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(Archer opens the cell door and holds his phase pistol to Orgoth's head.)
</font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">
ARCHER: Are you sure? <br/>
ORGOTH: Your threats aren't very convincing. I told you, you're too
civilised. <br/>
ARCHER: We'll see about that. <br/>(Archer marches him out of cell.) <br/>
GUARD: Sir! <br/>
ARCHER: As you were. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ARCHER:
(passing a woman) Ensign. <br/>
ORGOTH: Are you taking me to your torture chamber? <br/>
ARCHER: Shut up. <br/>(Archer opens an airlock.) <br/>ARCHER: Get in. <br/>(He pushes Orgoth in and closes
the airlock.) <br/>ARCHER: The Xindi. <br/>
ORGOTH: This tactic doesn't suit you, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: This airlock has a decompression rate of point five atmospheres
per minute. <br/>(Orgoth folds his arms so Archer goes to the control panel.)
<br/>ARCHER: You'd better start talking now, because in about forty seconds you
won't be able to. The Xindi. </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(Reed arrives with a security guard.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">
REED: Captain? <br/>
ARCHER: Everything's under control, Lieutenant. <br/>
REED: The airlock's decompressing, sir. He'll die. <br/>
ARCHER: Not for another twenty seconds he won't. The Xindi. <br/>
REED: Sir. <br/>
ARCHER: Your memory getting any better? (Orgoth nods) Say again? <br/>
REED: Captain! <br/>(Orgoth drops to his knees, Archer opens the door and
lets him crawl out.) <br/>
ARCHER: Take him back to the Brig. <br/>
REED: Let's go. <br/>(Reed and the guard haul Orgoth away.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Situation

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> T'POL:
Was he cooperative? <br/>
ARCHER: Eventually. When they attacked the Xindi ship they took more
than fuel and supplies. They downloaded their database. How close would
we have to get to tap into their main computer? <br/>
HOSHI: Pretty close. Less than a kilometre, but we need to have the
access codes. <br/>
ARCHER: He gave them to me. Here. <br/>
T'POL: They are heavily armed. Are you sure it's wise to engage them? <br/>
ARCHER: I want that database. Go to Tactical Alert. Tell Trip we're
going to need all the power he can spare for weapons and hull plating. <br/>
TRAVIS: Their ion trail's already started to decay. They're going to be
hard to find. <br/>
ARCHER: We're going to wait for them to find us, Travis. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TRAVIS:
Something's passing through the cloaking field. <br/>
ARCHER: Move us into position. (to Reed) Stand by. Have they detected
us? <br/>
T'POL: Not yet. <br/>
(As the Osaarian ship becomes visible, it gets hit by two torpedoes,
then another.) <br/>
ARCHER: Open a channel. <br/>
HOSHI: Go ahead. <br/>
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer. Remember us? You probably noticed that
our weapons are back online. You're outgunned, so stand down.
(Enterprise is hit by weapons fire) <br/>
TRAVIS: They're moving off. <br/>
ARCHER: One kilometre, Travis. (to Hoshi) Get ready. <br/>
REED: Hull plating's holding. <br/>
TRAVIS: They're heading back into the cloaking field. <br/>
ARCHER: Stay with them. <br/>(Both ships disappear into the field.) <br/>ARCHER: Hoshi? <br/>
HOSHI: We're not close enough. <br/>
TRAVIS: Stand by. <br/>
HOSHI: Another fifty metres. I'm into the computer. <br/>
T'POL: Anything? <br/>
HOSHI: I haven't found the Xindi database. I'm losing them. <br/>
ARCHER: Travis! <br/>(The data display comes back.) <br/>
T'POL: Forward hull plating is offline. <br/>
HOSHI: I've found it, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: How long do you need? <br/>
HOSHI: A few minutes. <br/>
T'POL: Hull fracture on E deck, section fourteen. We're venting
atmosphere. <br/>
ARCHER: Emergency bulkheads. <br/>
HOSHI: They're getting too far away. I'm losing the comm. link again. <br/>
TRAVIS: Our impulse drive's destabilising. We've got to get out of the
cloaking field, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: Head back to the sphere. <br/>(Enterprise re-emerges.) <br/>ARCHER: Where are
they? <br/>
TRAVIS: Still inside the field. <br/>
ARCHER: How much did you get? <br/>
HOSHI: About a third of it. <br/>
ARCHER: Take us closer to that portal. Let's see if we can lure them
back in here. Use our forward phase cannon. Fire a single burst,
minimum yield. <br/>(They blast a hole in the middle of the doors.) <br/>ARCHER: Travis? <br/>
TRAVIS: No sign of them. <br/>
ARCHER: Again. <br/>(Two phase cannons blow the entrance apart.) <br/>
TRAVIS: That got their attention. They're coming through. <br/>
ARCHER: Stay within a kilometre. Return fire. <br/>
HOSHI: I'm back in. <br/>
ARCHER: Can you take out their engines? <br/>
REED: Not without risking damage to their main computer. <br/>
ARCHER: Ensign. <br/>
HOSHI: I've got eighty percent, eighty five. <br/>
T'POL: Hull plating's offline. They're targeting our reactor. <br/>
HOSHI: I've got ninety percent. <br/>
ARCHER: Good enough. Mister Reed. <br/>
(Two torpedoes hit the stern of the Osaarian ship, and it scrapes the
side of the sphere as it tumbles.) <br/>
REED: Their engines are down. <br/>
ARCHER: Keep our weapons locked on them. </font></p>

Your codes worked. (to guard) Get him out of there. <br/>
ORGOTH: Now that I've served my purpose you're taking me back to the

ARCHER: Escort him to the Launch bay. We're taking you back to the
sphere. <br/>
