ARCHER: What about weapons? <br/>
TUCKER: This power grid's a mess! It's going to take a few minutes. <br/>
REED: Sir, the shields are functional. <br/>
ARCHER: Raise them. <br/>
REED: Our shields are weakening the clamps, but they're still holding. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll alternate port and starboard thrusters. That should shake
them loose. <br/>
T'POL: We're free. <br/>
ARCHER: Firing aft thrusters. <br/>
T'POL: Six Tholian ships moving toward us. <br/>
ARCHER: How much longer for weapons? <br/>
TUCKER: The power couplings have been removed. I don't know if I can
bypass them. <br/>
TRAVIS: Sir. <br/>

REED: Three more ships approaching. <br/>
TUCKER: Just a few more seconds! <br/>
(There's a jolt.) <br/>
ARCHER: What was that? <br/>
REED: They've locked on a tractor beam. We're being pulled back into
the dock. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARCHER: We need warp drive. <br/>
TUCKER: Engineering's been stripped to the bulkheads. But the good news
is, most of what they took was still sitting in my hangar deck. But I
need time to figure out how to put it all back together. <br/>
T'POL: How much time? <br/>
TUCKER: Two or three days. Sir, I'm not even sure what some of these
systems are supposed to do. It's like I'm Chief Engineer on a steamship
coming aboard the first interplanetary transport. <br/>
ARCHER: If we don't have warp capability in twelve hours, I'm going to
find a new Chief Engineer. <br/>
T'POL: I suggest we make use of the alien workers. They may know
something about these systems. <br/>
ARCHER: Keep them under close surveillance. Once warp drive is
restored, we'll set a course to rendezvous with the assault fleet. <br/>
T'POL: We're in no condition for battle. <br/>
REED: We made quick work of the Tholians. <br/>
T'POL: This ship is designed to be operated by a crew of four hundred.
There are only forty seven of us. The logical course of action is to
take Defiant to Earth, allow Starfleet to study it, reverse-engineer
its systems. <br/>
ARCHER: There's no time! The Empire could lose this war in a matter
weeks if we don't get the Defiant and its weapons to the front lines.
Dismissed! Commander. (grabs T'Pol's arm) Not you. <br/>
(The rest of the senior staff leave, and Archer takes Travis' weapon.) <br/>
ARCHER: I should shoot you for betraying me. <br/>
T'POL: The orders giving you command of Enterprise were obviously
fabricated. It was my duty as a Starfleet officer to help Captain
Forrest regain control of his ship. <br/>
ARCHER: You swore your loyalty to me. <br/>
T'POL: You should be aware Captain Forrest ordered me to kill you. <br/>
ARCHER: Why are you telling me this? <br/>
T'POL: Forrest is dead. His orders are no longer valid. You are my
commanding officer. <br/>
ARCHER: I never had a problem with your people until they became a part
of this rebellion. If I had another officer capable of doing your job,
I'd show you to the nearest airlock. I need you to get this ship up and
running. But if I hear so much as a rumour that you're working behind
my back <br/>
T'POL: Understood. <br/>
ARCHER: Get out. </font></p>

I found it in the Captain's wardrobe. <br/>
HOSHI: These people had some strange ideas about uniforms. <br/>
ARCHER: I can't find a mention of it anywhere. <br/>
HOSHI: A mention of what? <br/>
ARCHER: The Empire. As far as I can tell, it doesn't exist in the other
universe. <br/>
HOSHI: No Empire? <br/>
ARCHER: A lot of the names are the same, but their history has been
rewritten. Instead of building an empire, Earth became part of an
interspecies alliance. <br/>
HOSHI: (reading the desk monitor) The United Federation of Planets? <br/>
ARCHER: More like a Federation of Fools. <br/>
HOSHI: What about us? Do we exist in this universe? <br/>
ARCHER: Computer, access biographical file, Starfleet Officer Hoshi
Sato. <br/>
COMPUTER: Working. <br/>
(Everyone say Hi! to Majel Barrett Roddenberry's voice, in its
only appearance in this series.) <br/>
ARCHER: (reading) Hoshi Sato. Comm. Officer on Starfleet's first warp
five ship. In her late thirties, she created the linguacode translation
matrix. <br/>
HOSHI: At least she was remembered for something. <br/>
ARCHER: I can tell you who she married. It even says how you died. <br/>
HOSHI: Stop. I don't want to know. <br/>
ARCHER: But this isn't you. <br/>
HOSHI: I don't care. Computer. Display file on Starfleet Officer
Jonathan Archer. <br/>
COMPUTER: Working. <br/>
HOSHI: Son of famed warp specialist Henry Archer, Jonathan was
appointed Captain of Starfleet's first warp five ship. His name is
among the most recognised in the Federation. He earned an impressive
list of commendations during his career. Historians called him the
greatest explorer of the twenty second century. Two planets were named
after him. <br/>
(Archer switches it off with his fist.) <br/>
HOSHI: Hey. <br/>
ARCHER: There's nothing great about that man. He sold out Earth's
future to a group of subhuman species. Great men are not peacemakers.
Great men are conquerors. <br/>
HOSHI: Forget about him. Your future is just beginning. Can you imagine
the look on the Emperor's face when he sees this ship? You'll be
declared Hero of the Empire. Starfleet'll have to give you a command of
your own. <br/>
ARCHER: I already have a command of my own. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TUCKER: (in Engineering red) What's the problem? <br/>
KELBY: Commander. Somebody pulled both plasma regulators out of these
housings. <br/>
TUCKER: Why are you bothering me with this? They're probably on the
hangar deck. <br/>
KELBY: No, sir, you don't understand. They were here ten minutes ago. I
went to get this coupler. When I came back, the regulators were gone. <br/>
TUCKER: You'd better find them, because if this junction's not on line
in ten minutes, I'm going to tell Archer you're the reason we don't
have warp drive. <br/>
KELBY: Yes. Yes, sir. <br/>
(There's a strange noise, so Kelby climbs up into a junction to
investigate.) <br/>
KELBY: Who's in here? <br/>

him being dragged upwards. Screaming.)

combination mini-skirt and hot pants, for modesty.) <br/>
PHLOX: I found traces of reptilian saliva in the Ensign's wounds. <br/>
ARCHER: Something bit him? <br/>
PHLOX: The bite radius would suggest a particularly large reptile, more
than two metres in length. <br/>
ARCHER: Can you find this thing on internal sensors? <br/>
T'POL: It's not in the primary hull. Sensors are still offline on the
Engineering decks. <br/>
REED: Perhaps it was a pet owned by one of the original crew. <br/>
PHLOX: Unless one of them owned a velociraptor, I find it extremely
unlikely. <br/>
TUCKER: (entering) There's no sign of the regulators. Without them, we
can't initialise the reaction chamber. We're stuck at impulse. <br/>

disintegrate a person. I've been looking forward to trying it. <br/>
ALIEN: His name is Slar. <br/>
ARCHER: Who's name? <br/>
ALIEN: Our slave master. He was in charge of the salvage operation.
When you boarded the ship, he hid in the service crawlways. He was
planning to sabotage the ship. <br/>
ARCHER: Where in the crawlways? <br/>
ALIEN: Possibly near the power transfer conduits on deck twenty two.
It's warm there. His species likes it warm. <br/>

When my ship was in jeopardy, I didn't let Security handle the

similar in some respects, but their characters were weak and
compassionate. With the exception of Shakespeare, of course. From what
I could tell, his plays were equally grim in both universes. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOVAL: Enter. <br/>
(T'Pol enters, and raises her hand in the traditional Vulcan greeting.)
<br/>
SOVAL: It's not wise to make that gesture, even behind closed doors. It
is agreeable to see you again. <br/>
T'POL: Did you review the historical files? <br/>
SOVAL: The implications are intriguing. <br/>
T'POL: Intriguing? <br/>
SOVAL: This alternate universe is very different from ours. I'm not
certain a Federation could ever exist here. <br/>
T'POL: I thought you were an idealist. <br/>
SOVAL: That was many years ago. <br/>
T'POL: We have to take action. Archer intends to overthrow Starfleet
and the Emperor. <br/>
SOVAL; Archer is right. The Empire has become corrupt. A new leader may
change things for the better. <br/>
T'POL: Not for our people. The weapons on that ship will annihilate the
rebels, including thousands of Vulcans. We can give them an advantage. <br/>
SOVAL: How? <br/>
T'POL: I can download the data on Defiant's engines and tactical
systems. We'll give it to them. <br/>
SOVAL: Data will be of little value. Archer still controls that ship. <br/>
T'POL: I'm going to destroy that ship. <br/>
SOVAL: What? <br/>
T'POL: I can disable Defiant's power systems, but I'll need your help.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life serving the Empire? <br/>
SOVAL: I'm too old to become a revolutionary. <br/>
T'POL: I know Archer. He blames our people for inciting the rebels. If
he becomes Emperor, he'll lay waste to Vulcan. I can't do this without
you. </font></p>

when Hoshi wakes, and starts caressing and kissing him.) <br/>
ARCHER: My senior officers don't think I can do this. <br/>
HOSHI: They'll come around. <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pol doesn't approve, either. I can see it in her eyes. <br/>
HOSHI: Maybe it's time to get rid of her, now that this ship's
operational. <br/>
ARCHER: Not just her. We'll get rid of all the non-Terrans. I'll
transfer them off Defiant. <br/>
HOSHI: All of them? <br/>
ARCHER: The rebels have spies everywhere. I can't afford to have a
single alien aboard my flagship. <br/>
HOSHI: I hope you're not planning on getting sick anytime soon. In case
you haven't noticed, your doctor is an alien. <br/>
ARCHER: I've got nothing against Phlox. His people aren't rebels. It's
not in their nature. He can stay. <br/>
HOSHI: I've never been the consort of an Emperor before. Is there
anything I need to know? <br/>

is no longer required. <br/>

GARDNER [on viewscreen]: Archer. What the hell is going on? <br/>
ARCHER: I take it you received my message. <br/>
GARDNER [on viewscreen]: You demanded Starfleet's unconditional
surrender! Have you lost your mind? <br/>
ARCHER: You've seen the specs on the Defiant. You know what its weapons
can do. <br/>
GARDNER [on viewscreen]: I want to speak with Admiral Black. <br/>
ARCHER: He's not available right now. I suggest you order your forces
to stand down. Starfleet can't afford to lose any more ships. <br/>

approach Earth or you will be fired upon! </font></p>

SOVAL: You're the only non-Terran on the Defiant. Any of us would
arouse suspicion. <br/>
T'POL: You heard Archer's speech. He's delusional. <br/>
PHLOX: It's not a delusion if the Captain has the power to do what he
says. And from what I've seen, he most certainly does. I should report
you both. <br/>
SOVAL: Are you loyal to the Empire or not? <br/>
PHLOX: Of course I am! <br/>
T'POL: Archer plans to kill the Emperor and take his place. <br/>
PHLOX: The Captain has proven himself in battle. Perhaps he should rule
the Empire. <br/>
SOVAL: If Archer fails, his crew will have to answer for his crimes. <br/>
T'POL: We'll be executed. There's an old tradition. If someone saves
the Emperor's life, it's said there's no request he can refuse them.
Consider the possibilities.
A medical facility of your own with unlimited resources. You could
conduct experiments as you see fit. <br/>

life. I suppose what you're suggesting isn't that different. </font></p>

they? <br/>

HOSHI: I was hoping you'd put up a fight. <br/>

jumped into recently. <br/>

that area. <br/>
