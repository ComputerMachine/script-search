land at their rough and ready camp. It's the movie 'First Contact',
basically, as Zephram Cochrane comes forward to meet their Vulcan

VULCAN: Live long and prosper. <br/>
(Zephram tries to mimic his salute, then (in close up) we see his hand
go into his coat and pull out a big gun with which he shoots the Vulcan
dead. This is a cue for the rest of the group.) <br/>
MAN: Board that ship! Take everything you can! <br/>

that start the same and then become very different with images of
conflict instead of exploration, and a final logo of Earth with a sword
through it. Anyone else old enough to recognise it?)

REED: (in MACO uniform) The Booth will be far more effective than our
previous disciplinary methods. <br/>
PHLOX: It can stimulate the pain centre of virtually any humanoid. A
synaptic scan calibrates it for each species. <br/>
ARCHER: They call this progress. <br/>
FORREST: There's something to be said for a good, old-fashioned
flogging. <br/>
REED: Well, that's what's so exceptional about this device. Traditional
forms of punishment can overwhelm the nervous system. After a time, the
brain ceases to feel anything. <br/>
PHLOX: These sensors continually shift the stimulation from one nerve
cluster to another, keeping the subject in a constant state of agony. <br/>
FORREST: I think you enjoy your work too much, Doctor. <br/>
ARCHER: What exactly did Mister Terev do? <br/>

going into Tholian space based on data from some anonymous source.
Maybe you haven't heard, but we have a rebellion to put down. The
Tholians aren't part of it. <br/>
ARCHER: You saw the data. This technology would give us a tactical
advantage. We could end the war tomorrow. <br/>
FORREST: You see this as your big chance, don't you? <br/>
ARCHER: Sir? <br/>
FORREST: You bring that ship home, and you'll be a hero. The Emperor
pins a medal on your chest. You might even get that command you've
always wanted. <br/>

FORREST: Resume your station. <br/>

HOSHI: And probably the only one who doesn't want to slip a knife in
your back. I heard the battle went well at Tau Ceti. <br/>
FORREST: Is that what you heard? <br/>
HOSHI: Word on the ship is the war may be over soon. I'll go back to
Brazil, start teaching again. You'll accept a comfortable desk job at
Headquarters. We'll have the weekends. <br/>
FORREST: You've been listening to propaganda. Things went badly at Tau
Ceti. Very badly. We lost twelve ships. Keep this to yourself. If the

T'POL: You are in command. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm glad we can agree on something. Do you recognise this?
(holds up a gun) It belonged to Zefram Cochrane. He used it to kill the
first Vulcan who stepped onto Terran soil. I wonder how history would
have played out if Cochrane hadn't turned the tables on your invasion
force. Humans might be your slaves instead of the other way around. <br/>
T'POL: I'm not a slave. <br/>
ARCHER: You're Vulcan. Never forget that. How long until we cross into
Tholian space? <br/>
T'POL: It's likely we already have. They frequently annex systems
outside their core territory. <br/>
ARCHER: There's a warp signature encoded on this. Notify me the moment
you find it. <br/>
T'POL: If there's nothing further. <br/>
ARCHER: There is. I'm promoting you to First Officer. <br/>
T'POL: Major Reed's next in line. He won't be pleased. <br/>
ARCHER: Reed is a capable soldier, but he has trouble following orders.
And I know he has ambitions of his own. <br/>
T'POL: You've made it clear you don't approve of Vulcans. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe this is my way of saying thank you to you and your

congratulate you on a brilliant strategy. I'm certain that in years to

your expertise. <br/>

sorry if I hurt you. <br/>
ARCHER: You saw an opportunity for advancement, and you took it. <br/>
HOSHI: Just as you did. You should've been Captain from the moment we
left Spacedock. You've always known that. If it hadn't been for all
those Admirals conspiring behind your back, Enterprise would have been
yours. Tradition says that whatever belonged to the previous Captain is
yours for the taking. <br/>

dead star. The explosion created an interphasic rift. A doorway into
another universe. <br/>
TUCKER: A doorway. <br/>
ARCHER: The rift was unstable. It was too dangerous to send one of
their own ships through, so they transmitted a distress call into the
opening, hoping to lure a ship from the other side. Their plan worked
brilliantly. <br/>
HOSHI: How did you learn all this? <br/>
ARCHER: The Tholians rely on outside labourers. Humanoids. Some of them
can be bought for the right price. <br/>
TUCKER: I hope you didn't pay too much. <br/>
ARCHER: My contact transmitted these images before his signal was
jammed. <br/>
TUCKER: You can barely see anything. <br/>
ARCHER: Computer, enhance grid three alpha. <br/>
(Just sticking out of the moon is the saucer section of NCC1764.) <br/>
FORREST: An Earth ship? <br/>
ARCHER: According to some theories, everything that exists in our
universe should also exist there. <br/>
HOSHI: Another Terran Empire? Another Starfleet? <br/>
TUCKER: So what? How does this help us? <br/>
ARCHER: The Tholians quantum-dated a piece of the hull. This ship is
not only from another universe, it's from another time. About a hundred
years into the future. Imagine the technology we can find on that ship.
New tactical systems, advanced bio-weapons. Engines that can reach
speeds we can only dream of. All of it ours for the taking! <br/>
T'POL: This is ludicrous, Captain. Someone has fabricated this evidence
to lure us here. Commander Archer is guilty of assault and mutiny. <br/>
FORREST: That's enough, Commander. <br/>
T'POL: Sir, I believe we should send <br/>
FORREST: I said shut up! We're investigating this. Get that cloaking
device working. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">T'POL: The Captain wants a progress report. <br/>
TUCKER: I'll need another minute to calibrate the field converters. I
spent four hours in the Booth because of you. <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps you should direct your anger at Commander Archer. <br/>
TUCKER: You disabled the alarms in that junction and made it look like
I did it. <br/>
T'POL: You're mistaken. <br/>
TUCKER: The hell I am! I think I'd remember if I had sabotaged the
ship! <br/>
T'POL: Not necessarily. <br/>
TUCKER: What did you do to me? <br/>
T'POL: I lured you away from Engineering with the promise of a sexual
encounter. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">T'POL: My mind to your mind. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: Once we were alone in my quarters, I implanted a telepathic
suggestion. <br/>
T'POL: My thoughts to your thoughts. <br/>

melded again. I altered your memory of what had happened. It was my
duty to help Captain Forrest regain command. <br/>
TUCKER: You're going to regret what you did. <br/>
T'POL: Threats are illogical. <br/>

T'POL: We've reached the coordinates. Autonavigation has disengaged. <br/>
FORREST: Let's see where we are. <br/>
(It's an aqua-coloured gas giant with rings and moons.) <br/>
ARCHER: Magnify the moon on the far right. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">T'POL: Primary systems are offline, including life
support. We're reading thirteen biosigns, all alien. One of them
appears to be reptilian. They're clustered in this section. <br/>
(She indicates the area where the nacelles join the lower decks.) <br/>
ARCHER: Any sign of the crew? <br/>
T'POL: We've detected no human signatures. <br/>
REED: It's likely the crew was executed. <br/>
TUCKER: Look at the size of those coils. I'll bet that thing could do
warp seven. <br/>
FORREST: We'll send an assault team aboard. You brought us here, you
lead it. Download whatever you can from the database, then destroy the
ship. <br/>
ARCHER: Destroy it? We have to take the ship with us. <br/>
FORREST: It's too dangerous. We are deep in Tholian space. <br/>
ARCHER: Sir, you can't do this. <br/>
FORREST: You have your orders! Dismissed. <br/>
(Archer, Reed and Tucker leave.) <br/>
FORREST: (to T'Pol) Go with him. I don't want Archer to return from
this mission. Do I make myself clear, Commander? </font></p>

ARCHER: They're gutting the ship. <br/>

T'POL: Human. <br/>
(Archer rolls him over. Ensign Ricky has a big hole in his chest.
Archer picks up his phaser.) <br/>
REED: If you'd like, sir, I could hold that for you. <br/>

Tholians start firing at them.) <br/>
