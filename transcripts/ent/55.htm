T'POL: I don't usually eat this late. <br/>
TUCKER: Come on. One bite? <br/>(He takes the lid off.) <br/>
T'POL: (takes a bite) This doesn't make up for the two sessions you
cancelled. <br/>
TUCKER: Maybe you haven't noticed, but I've been a little busy lately.
It's not like I didn't want to come back. After our last session I
slept like a baby. First time in months. So, should I just <br/>
T'POL: Please. <br/>(He takes his shirt off and sits down.) <br/>T'POL: Your shoes as well. <br/>
TUCKER: Shoes? <br/>
T'POL: There are many neural nodes in the soles of the feet. <br/>
TUCKER: Hold on. You never said anything about feet. <br/>
T'POL: Is that a problem? <br/>
TUCKER: Well, for one thing, I haven't had a shower since this morning,
and I know how sensitive that Vulcan nose of your can be. And I'm a
little ticklish. Maybe more than a little. <br/>

Sorry if I woke you. <br/>
T'POL: I wasn't asleep. <br/>
ARCHER: Look at this. <br/>(A picture of an Arboreal comes on the screen.) <br/>
T'POL: Another species of Xindi? <br/>
ARCHER: According to Phlox, they probably evolved from some form of
arboreal primate. I managed to piece together some of their starcharts.
It took me half the night to figure out how they map co-ordinates, but
I've been able to reconstruct the ship's course over the past few
months. This is the last planet they visited before they were attacked
by the marauders. <br/>
T'POL: Does it say what they were doing there? <br/>
ARCHER: No, but it's only a day away. <br/>
T'POL: We don't know if these Xindi were involved with the ones who
attacked Earth. <br/>
ARCHER: We don't know they weren't. Tell Travis to set a course. </font></p>

The ecosystem is prolific. There are several million chromophyllic
plant species alone. <br/>
ARCHER: What about Xindi? <br/>
T'POL: I'm not detecting any humanoid life, but it'll take several
hours to search all the land masses. <br/>
REED: Captain, I'm picking up a metallic signature at the northern end
of those equatorial islands. It looks like a landing craft. <br/>
ARCHER: Any bioscans? <br/>

Sir. <br/>(He arrives at the alien craft. The hatch is open and it's empty.) <br/>
T'POL: Judging by the oxidation, this happened about two weeks ago. <br/>
HOSHI: Right about the time the Xindi were here. <br/>
ARCHER: It's definitely one of theirs. I recognise it from the
database. (to Reed) Search the area. See what else you can find. (to
T'Pol) Some of their databanks may still be intact. <br/>
HOSHI: Captain. A body. <br/>(A very burnt body.) <br/>
T'POL: It isn't Xindi. At least, not one of the three species we're
familiar with. <br/>
HOSHI: Maybe it was one of the other two. <br/>
REED: What about him? <br/>
T'POL: The readings are the same. <br/>
ARCHER: This whole area's been scorched. <br/>
HOSHI: Are you all right? <br/>
REED: (sweating) I never much care for the tropics. <br/>
ARCHER: Keep looking. </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(T'Pol finds mottling on her forearms and feels ridges developing
around her eyes.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">
T'POL: Lieutenant? <br/>

externally, and it hurts.) <br/>

mutated Hoshi. When Reed turns up too, she runs away but trips up and
passes out. The changed crew carry her to a clearing where she wakes
again.) <br/>
T'POL: Captain, untie me. Let me go. <br/>(He does, over Hoshi's protests.)
<br/>T'POL: Thank you. <br/>(Archer sniffs around her neck and makes clicking sounds.) <br/>T'POL: We have

talk. Talk. You need to talk. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PHLOX:
That's a Vulcan biosign, I'm certain of it. <br/>
TUCKER: But these aren't human. <br/>
PHLOX: Definitely not. <br/>
TUCKER: Then where's the rest of our team? The only reason I don't have
a search party down there right now is because you needed more time to
analyse the data. Now unless you can give me a damn good reason to wait
around <br/>
PHLOX: When T'Pol called to the ship, she said something was happening
to them. <br/>
TRAVIS: She said they were being altered. <br/>
PHLOX: It's possible she was speaking literally. Something on the
planet may have transformed them, physiologically. <br/>
TUCKER: You're saying these alien biosigns could be our people. <br/>
PHLOX: From what we've seen of the Expanse, it's a possibility we have
to consider. The laws of biochemistry on this world may be just as
unpredictable as the laws of physics. <br/>
TRAVIS: Whoever they are, they're not staying put. They're heading due
east of the landing site. <br/>
TUCKER: Prep shuttlepod two. <br/>
TRAVIS: Aye, sir. <br/>
PHLOX: I'd like a little more time to study these readings. <br/>
TUCKER: We'll use EV suits and biohazard protocols. Have the Decon
chamber ready when we get back. </font></p>

T'POL: Yes. It's your ship. You're the Captain. <br/>
REED: We don't have time for this. We have to find Urquat. It's all
that matters now. <br/>
T'POL: Urquat? <br/>
REED: We have to keep looking. It's somewhere close. <br/>
HOSHI: Why are you talking to her? She's trying to delay us. Our people
are there. <br/>
REED: They can help us, tell us what happened, why we can't remember. <br/>
T'POL: Captain, that device. I can use it to call Enterprise. You have
a doctor on board. He can prove to you what I'm saying is true. <br/>
HOSHI: Don't trust her. She's not one of us. <br/>
ARCHER: We don't know what she is. <br/>
T'POL: Urquat. You said we need to find Urquat. We should keep
searching. </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(Archer grabs T'Pols arm and pulls her along.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">
ARCHER: It can't be far. <br/>
(Reed scents food, and leaps easily up a tree. He comes back with two
eggs to eat, Archer snatches one and Hoshi gets the other. She opens it
to reveal some larvae which she devours hungrily. Reed is annoyed and
he fights Archer, but he loses and crawls away. Archer breaks open the
other egg and offers some to T'Pol.)<br/>
T'POL: No, thank you. I'm not hungry. <br/>(Archer lets a contrite and
begging Reed have a share) </font></p>

(Archer and Co. hide, then Reed jumps one of the MACOs. Hoshi gets
shot.) <br/>TUCKER: Chang! <br/>
(Tucker stuns Reed, but Archer attacks him with a club and cracks his
faceplate.) <br/>

other MACO arrives.) <br/>T'POL: Take Lieutenant Reed back to Sickbay. <br/>

is watching Reed rage in the Decon chamber, on a monitor.)<br/>
TUCKER: He didn't even recognise me. <br/>
PHLOX: Don't be offended. In his current condition, I doubt he'd
recognise any of us. <br/>
TUCKER: Any idea what caused this? <br/>
PHLOX: A mutagenic virus. His blood was swarming with them. It was
apparently designed to re-write the DNA of its host, to transform any
humanoid it infected into another species. <br/>
TUCKER: Why did it have so little effect on T'Pol? <br/>
PHLOX: Vulcan K-cells. They seem to neutralise the pathogen. I've been
synthesising an anti-virus using T'Pol's genetic profile, but I'm going
to need an active sample of her DNA to complete it. We need to get her
back to the ship as soon as possible. <br/>

TUCKER: Open a channel. <br/>
TRET [on viewscreen]: Your ship is in restricted space. <br/>
TUCKER: Sorry, it wasn't very well marked. <br/>
TRET [on viewscreen]: Our scans indicate that one of the people on your
ship has been infected with a dangerous virus. <br/>
TUCKER: We're aware of that. Is there anything you can tell us about <br/>
TRET [on viewscreen]: Your vessel's under quarantine. Prepare to be
boarded. <br/>
TUCKER: No one's coming aboard unless I say so. <br/>
TRET [on viewscreen]: The infected organism must be eradicated before
the virus can spread. <br/>
TUCKER: That infected organism is a member of my crew. <br/>
TRET [on viewscreen]: Does he still look like one of your crew? Does he
recognise you or even speak your language anymore? We've been studying
the mutagen for sixty years. The only course of action is to neutralise
the outbreak. <br/>
TUCKER: There isn't any outbreak. Lieutenant Reed is in medical
isolation. <br/>
TRET [on viewscreen]: We won't allow your vessel to leave orbit with
the contagion aboard. <br/>
TUCKER: Look, we've only been dealing with this virus for one day, so
forgive me if I don't take your word for it that the only option is to
neutralise our Tactical Officer. You want to come over to discuss the
situation, fine, but if you try to force your way onto this ship you're
going to have one hell of a fight on your hands. </font></p>

How long was I asleep? <br/>
T'POL: Only for a few minutes. <br/>
ARCHER: I saw it. In my dream, I was there. <br/>
HOSHI: Urquat? <br/>
ARCHER: Our city. <br/>
T'POL: There are no cities on this planet. <br/>
ARCHER: You're wrong. It's below the surface. <br/>
HOSHI: Tell me. What was it like? <br/>
ARCHER: It was filled with thousands of Loque'eque, waiting for us. <br/>
T'POL: Your home is a planet called Earth. The people there are waiting
for you. You're on a mission to save them. <br/>
ARCHER: Urquat's my home. When we get there you'll understand. Wait and
see. We've rested long enough. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PHLOX:
The Decon chamber's sealed. I assure you there's no danger. <br/>
TRET: You wouldn't be so confident if you knew how easily this virus
can spread. It infected tens of millions of people on my world. They
all had to be destroyed. <br/>
TUCKER: Destroyed? <br/>
TRET: The virus would have transformed our entire population within
weeks. <br/>
TUCKER: Where did it come from? <br/>
TRET: It was engineered by the inhabitants of this planet, a race
called the Loque'eque. Something decimated their species centuries ago
and they lost the ability to reproduce, so they created this virus to
transform other species into their own. It was the only way to save
themselves from extinction. <br/>
PHLOX: Ingenious, but why didn't they programme the virus to stop
replicating once their population was replenished? <br/>
TRET: We've been trying to answer that question for a long time. <br/>
TUCKER: Why's he so eager to get back to a place called Urquat? <br/>
TRET: The mutagen encodes the victims with an overpowering instinct to
return to their home city, Urquat. That's why we can't allow even a
single infected organism to leave this planet. They can spread the
contagion to other systems and anyone who became infected would be
drawn back here. We can't risk another epidemic. (his communicator
sounds) Yes. <br/>
ALIEN [OC]: We've detected three more infected organisms on the
surface. <br/>
TRET: Prepare a containment team. More of your crewmen? <br/>
PHLOX: One of them has an immunity to the virus. If I could have access
to some of your research, perhaps we could work together. <br/>
TRET: We will find these people and examine them. If there's anything
to report, we'll let you know. <br/>
TUCKER: I'd prefer to have Doctor Phlox examine them. <br/>
TRET: What you prefer doesn't matter. I'm under orders to contain this
outbreak. If you attempt to interfere, I'm authorised to use any force
necessary. (to guard) Take me back to the airlock. (leaves) <br/>
PHLOX: If I don't complete the antivirus within the next two hours,
it'll be too late. There won't be enough of their original genome left
to resequence. <br/>
TUCKER: We can't launch a shuttlepod, they'd detect it. Do you think
T'Pol's contagious? <br/>
PHLOX: Most likely. <br/>
TUCKER: That rules out the transporter. She'd infect the entire crew. <br/>

sample. <br/>

PHLOX: You're welcome to some of the moth larvae I feed to my Pyrithian
bat. <br/>
ARCHER: How are you feeling, Lieutenant? <br/>
REED: Not bad, sir. How about yourself? <br/>
ARCHER: Getting there. Hoshi and T'Pol are going to take the day off.
You might want to do the same. <br/>
REED: Thank you, Captain. I could use a little rest. <br/>(Reed leaves.) <br/>
ARCHER: You wanted to see me? <br/>
PHLOX: This is the last of the mutagenic virus. I assume you want me to
destroy it. <br/>
ARCHER: No. <br/>
PHLOX: Captain, you experienced first-hand what this pathogen can do. <br/>
ARCHER: Those containment patrols aren't going to stop until they've
wiped out every trace of it. Now that they have your antivirus, they'll
most likely figure out a way to succeed. <br/>
PHLOX: Considering the alternatives, that would be best. <br/>
ARCHER: (takes the vial) This was created as a final effort to preserve
a civilisation, a people. That species we became, they cease to exist
the moment this virus is gone. <br/>
PHLOX: Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: We came out here to stop the Xindi destroying humanity. I'll be
damned if I'm going to have a hand in destroying another race in the
process. Put it on ice, Doc, in stasis, whatever. Understood? <br/>
(Phlox nods, and puts it into a tiny metal box.) </font> </p>
