T'POL: Jonathan, please, sit down. I'll answer all of your questions.
Today is a very important day. I have a great deal to tell you. What's
the last thing you remember? <br/>

caused by an anomaly. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Take us out of warp. <br/>

How do you feel? <br/>
ARCHER: Like a shuttle pod landed on my head. Was anyone else hurt? <br/>
PHLOX: No. Captain, there are a few questions I have to ask you. <br/>
ARCHER: Well, it'll have to wait. I want to get to the Bridge. <br/>(He gets up
and fetches his uniform.) <br/>
PHLOX: I'm afraid I have to insist. When did you last speak to
Commander Tucker? <br/>
ARCHER: This morning, staff briefing. Why? What's going on, Phlox? <br/>
PHLOX: The anomaly in the corridor left something behind. We've never
seen it before. This is a microcellular scan of your hippocampus.
You've been infected by several clusters of parasites. They haven't
caused any tissue damage but they're impairing certain synaptic
functions. They're preventing you from forming new long term memories. <br/>
ARCHER: Long term. <br/>
PHLOX: You can recall events that happened before the infection, but
everything after fades within a few hours. Captain, you've been in
Sickbay for the past three days. You last spoke to Commander Tucker
about seven hours ago. He came to see you, right here. <br/>
ARCHER: You can't remove these parasites? <br/>
PHLOX: So far, they haven't responded to any traditional therapies, but
I'm synthesising an antigen that shows some promise. You can be assured
I won't stop working on this until I find a cure. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: The doctor continued to search for a remedy over the next
several weeks. Commander Tucker and I did our best to keep you updated
each day on the progress of our mission. </font></p>

It looked like we had a lead on that Xindi ship, the one we planted
that tracking devise on, but it turned out to be a garbage scow. <br/>
T'POL: They were carrying a shipment with the same radiolytic
signature. <br/>
ARCHER: I had an idea this morning, after you told me what happened. I
came up with a way to upgrade the antimatter inducers. We can travel
farther on less fuel. Let me guess. I already gave you these specs. <br/>
TUCKER: A week ago, but your upgrades are working nicely. Well, I
should get back to Engineering. See you both later. <br/>(Tucker leaves.)<br/>
ARCHER: I imagine that must happen often. Maybe these daily briefings
aren't such a good idea. Looks like it's just a waste of your time, and
Trip's. <br/>
T'POL: I disagree. We both rely on your experience. You can still
contribute to the success of this mission. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sure you have work to do. I'll be in my quarters. <br/>
T'POL: In the corridor, when the anomaly hit, I urged you to leave me
behind. If you had, it's likely I'd be the one suffering from this
condition. <br/>
ARCHER: Fortunately, I don't take orders from you. <br/>
T'POL: Captain, I never expressed my gratitude for what you did. <br/>
ARCHER: I suppose there's not much point in thanking me. A few hours
from now I won't remember. </font></p>

HOSHI [OC]: We're receiving a haul through the subspace buoy. It's
Starfleet. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Archer

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> T'POL:
It was Admiral Forrest. The Command Council had reviewed the Doctor's
report on your condition. They relieved you of duty and granted me a
field commission. <br/>
ARCHER: Forrest made you Captain. I suppose congratulations are in
order, even if they are belated. I guess these parasites weren't so
easy to remove after all. <br/>
T'POL: Phlox discovered that the organisms are from a domain outside
normal space-time. They exist in a state of interspatial flux. None of
his treatments had any effect on them. <br/>
ARCHER: What about the mission? Did you find the Xindi weapon? <br/>
T'POL: After several months of searching, we learned where the weapon
was being constructed, but the Xindi knew we were getting close. They
dispatched two vessels to intercept us.

HOSHI: They're locking on to the starboard docking port. <br/>
T'POL: Send security teams.<br/>
(The Reptilians are looking for Archer. One finds his quarters and
kills his guard then goes in, but Archer puts up a good fight and
eventually stabs him through the chest with a statuette.)<br/>
HOSHI: I'm reading twenty three intruders on decks C, D and E. <br/>
T'POL: Have your men set up a defence perimeter on B deck. <br/>

Xindi vessel and breaks up. The starboard nacelle is damaged too.)<br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PHLOX:
We've lost thirteen of the crew, twenty two injured, several critical. <br/>
T'POL: The Xindi? <br/>
REED: We've taken nine prisoners but the Brig was only designed for
two. I'm not sure what to do with the others. <br/>
TUCKER: Blow them out the airlock. <br/>
T'POL: Put them in crew quarter's under heavy guard. How are the
repairs coming? <br/>
TUCKER: We should have hull plating and torpedoes in the next couple of
hours. The warp drive's another question. The starboard nacelle's a
lost cause, half the coils have been fused. <br/>
T'POL: How long to repair them? <br/>
TUCKER: If we were at Jupiter station, three weeks. Out here I'd have
to rebuild the coil assembly from scratch. Six months minimum. For now
the best I can give you is a warp one point seven. <br/>
REED: We're not going to get very far at that speed. <br/>
T'POL: Resume our previous heading. Dismissed. <br/>(The others leave.) <br/>
TUCKER: How can we keep going with one warp engine? <br/>
T'POL: There's no option. <br/>
TUCKER: What the world where you thinking when you rammed that ship? <br/>
T'POL: I chose the logical course of action. <br/>
TUCKER: Since the Captain got sick, this mission's taken one wrong turn
after another. <br/>
T'POL: If you believe I've acted improperly, I suggest you contact
Admiral Forrest. </font></p>

You said we eventually found the weapon. How could we manage that
without warp engines? <br/>
T'POL: We located the facility where the Xindi constructed the probe,
but it had already been deployed. <br/>
ARCHER: Earth? <br/>
T'POL: Destroyed. They didn't stop at your homeworld. They attacked
every human outpost they could find. Mars, Alpha Centauri, Vega colony,
all were destroyed. <br/>

from the Expanse. <br/>

T'POL: Most of them are still aboard the ship. It's in orbit,
patrolling this system. <br/>
ARCHER: How did all these people get here? <br/>

take refuge.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">T'POL:
Come in <br/>
SOVAL: That uniform doesn't suit you, Captain. <br/>
T'POL: I doubt you travelled all this way to criticise my attire. <br/>
SOVAL: I want you to return with me to Vulcan. <br/>
T'POL: I'm no longer under your authority. <br/>
SOVAL: It's not an order, it's a request for your own safety. Two weeks
ago, the High Command received a distress call from the Earth convoy in
the Mutara system. By the time our ships reached them, they found
nothing but a field of debris. The weapon signatures were Xindi. Even
if your ships do manage to reach Ceti Alpha, it's most likely you'll
find an armada waiting for you. <br/>
T'POL: We're prepared to confront them. <br/>
SOVAL: It was a mistake ordering you to leave Enterprise. It forced you
to make an impulsive decision. If you return with me now, the High
Command is prepared to reinstate your rank. <br/>
T'POL: I won't leave them. <br/>
SOVAL: Them or him? There are specialists on Vulcan that can help
Archer. <br/>
T'POL: You'd take him as well? <br/>
SOVAL: If you return to Vulcan. You owe the humans nothing. They chose
to leave Earth before they were ready. If they'd accepted our counsel,
this tragedy would have been avoided. <br/>
T'POL: We could have saved them. <br/>
SOVAL: How?<br/>
T'POL: We held back their warp programme for one hundred years. A
policy which you supported. If we would have helped them develop faster
ships, better defences. <br/>
SOVAL: Your emotional attachment to Archer is clouding your logic.
We'll be within range for another thirty hours, should you reconsider. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ARCHER:
Come in. Did things go well with the Vulcans? <br/>
T'POL: How did you know that they were? <br/>
ARCHER: There was obviously a reason I chose these quarters. You can
see a lot from this window. What did they want? <br/>
T'POL: They were here to replenish our supplies. <br/>
ARCHER: Ha. I've been thinking about everything you told me. I realise
I'm not fit to command the ship, but there's got to be some way I can
help. I could give Trip a hand in Engineering. <br/>
T'POL: We tried something similar to that a few months ago. It was
uncomfortable for you. <br/>
ARCHER: So I'm supposed to stay locked up in my quarters all day? <br/>
T'POL: You often take Porthos for a walk, visit the classrooms on D
deck. The children enjoy hearing about our earlier missions. <br/>
ARCHER: In other words, just stay out of the way. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: After nearly a year, we arrived in this system. Our convey
was the only one to reach it. The others had all been attacked and
destroyed. </font></p>

This planet's barely Minshara-class. Maybe we should've picked one with
a little more blue and green on it.
I'd like to head down with a survey team and start scouting for colony
sites. <br/>
T'POL: You're needed on Enterprise. The civilian leaders are going to
want to meet with you. <br/>
TUCKER: Me? You're the one they deal with. <br/>
T'POL: I'm resigning my commission. <br/>
TUCKER: You're sure you want to do this? <br/>
T'POL: Captain Archer will be better off on the surface with the
others. He'll need a caretaker, someone he trusts. I can't be in two
places at the same time. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">T'POL:
The civilian ships were disassembled for their components and raw
materials. We used them to construct the settlement. At this point, you
often wonder if you're a victim of some elaborate deception. <br/>
ARCHER: The thought did cross my mind. <br/>
T'POL: Margaret Mullin. You met her when you were twenty four years
old, during flight school in San Francisco. The night before you
graduated, you asked her to marry you, outside of her apartment on
Westgate Avenue. She turned you down. She said she didn't want to
become a Starfleet widow. <br/>
ARCHER: How the hell did you know that? <br/>
T'POL: Our relationship has evolved over the years. <br/>
ARCHER: Exactly how far has it evolved? (Later, Phlox has arrived. </font><font face="Arial" size="2">His hair is longer, but that's all.)<br/>PHLOX: Nothing seems to have changed
since your last exam. <br/>
ARCHER: Is this why you came all the way from Denobula, to give me a
check-up? <br/>
PHLOX: You didn't tell him? After this settlement was established, it
became clear that I was never going to find a treatment for your
condition if I remained here, so I returned home and consulted with
some of the finest neurosurgeons and quantum theorists on Denobula. My
colleagues believed there was no way to destroy these parasites short
of vaporising you in a subspace implosion. They assured me the
technology to do what was required did not exist, and they were
correct. It took almost a decade to develop, but now I'm ready to put
it to the test. The procedure requires tremendous amounts of energy,
levels that can only be produced in the reactor of a warp powered
starship. <br/>

PHLOX: This image was taken a few minutes ago. You can see the region
where I eradicated the first cluster of parasites. It's gone in this
image, as well. <br/>
TUCKER: Doc. <br/>
PHLOX: This scan was taken over twelve years ago. The cluster has
disappeared from all the scans I've taken over the last twelve years.
It's as if it never existed at all <br/>
T'POL: By destroying the organisms in the present, we appear to have
neutralised them in the past. <br/>
PHLOX: We know they're from another spatial domain. Apparently, they
also exist outside of time. If we can eliminate all of the parasites,
it's possible the Captain's infection will never have occurred. <br/>
T'POL: History may be altered. Captain Archer will have remained in
command of Enterprise. Our mission in the Expanse could have an
entirely different outcome. <br/>
PHLOX: We only have to divert power for a few hours. I am certain I can
complete the procedure in that time. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm sorry. We need all the power we've got for the weapons. <br/>
T'POL: If the Xindi are on their way there's very little we can do to
stop them.. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, we can't just run up the white flag.<br/>
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Tucker. You'd better get up here, sir. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm on my way. We'll talk about this later. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">HOSHI:
I'm getting a signal from one of our sentry probes. Six Xindi ships
have entered the system. <br/>
TUCKER: Charge the phase cannons. Is everyone in position? <br/>
HOSHI: Aye, sir. <br/>
REED: The Xindi ships are in range. <br/>
TUCKER: Fire! <br/>
REED: Our shields are holding. Nice to know they work in combat. <br/>
TUCKER: Remind me to send a note to General Shran. Adjust your heading.
Three one oh mark two seven. Full impulse. <br/>
HOSHI: Two of their ships are breaking off. They're following us. <br/>
TUCKER: What about the others? <br/>
HOSHI: Still heading towards the planet. <br/>
(As Enterprise leads the two ships off, two more appear at the rear and
attack the intruders.) <br/>
REED: The Insectoid ship's been damaged. They're losing power. <br/>
TUCKER: Target the second one. <br/>
REED: Their engine's disabled. <br/>
HOSHI: The other Xindi ships have changed their heading. <br/>
TUCKER: I think we're going to find out how much of a beating these new
shields can take. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ARCHER:
T'Pol, what's happening? <br/>
T'POL: Jonathan, you need to rest. Where are you going? <br/>
ARCHER: To the Bridge. I'm not going to just lie here while they
destroy what's left of humanity. <br/>
T'POL: (to Phlox) You should remain here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
(Enterprise is taking a beating.) <br/>
REED: Forward shielding's at fifty two percent.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ARCHER:
Turbolifts are down. <br/>
(He and T'Pol use the Jefferies tubes.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">HOSHI:
Intrepid's taken a direct hit. They've lost their port nacelle. <br/>
TUCKER: Tell them to withdraw. <br/>
REED: Our phase cannons are down. Our forward shield's collapsing! <br/>
HOSHI: Hull breaches on B deck, C deck! <br/>
REED: They're targeting the Bridge! <br/>
TUCKER: Hard to port! <br/>
(The top of the ship is blown off.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(They
come out of the tube to a status panel.) <br/>
ARCHER: The Bridge is gone. <br/>
T'POL: T'Pol to Phlox. <br/>
PHLOX [OC]: Go ahead. <br/>
T'POL: Meet us in Engineering. We're going to finish the procedure. <br/>
PHLOX [OC]: Understood. <br/>
ARCHER: We don't have time to worry about parasites right now. <br/>
T'POL: That's not necessarily true. Come with me. I'll explain. <br/>
(Meanwhile, Xindi reptilians are beaming aboard and massacring the
crew.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PHLOX:
I'm sorry, Captain. The chamber's been damaged. <br/>
ARCHER: Didn't you say that we could destroy the parasites with a
subspace implosion? <br/>
T'POL: Yes, but then we <br/>
ARCHER: Can we create one? <br/>
T'POL: We would have to overload three plasma injectors. That would
send a feedback pulse through the reactor. <br/>
PHLOX: You'll destroy the ship? <br/>
ARCHER: At this point, it won't make much of a difference. You two get
to a shuttlepod. They're only after humans. If this doesn't work out
you'll still have a chance. That's an order. </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(T'Pol joins him at the controls.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">
T'POL: With all due respect, you were
relieved of command. <br/>
ARCHER: One of the plasma injectors was damaged. We'll have to replace
it. They're in supply locker C on the upper level. <br/>(Phlox goes to get
it while MACOs try to hold off the reptilians.) <br/>ARCHER: We're back in business. <br/>
(Xindi get into Engineering. Phlox kills one but the other gets him and
he falls from the upper level.) <br/>ARCHER: Phlox! Phlox? <br/>(Archer returns
fire.) <br/>ARCHER: How much longer? <br/>
T'POL: Stand by. <br/>
(She's also hit, but Archer enters the code before he gets shot as
well. He pushes the final lever with his dying breath and the ship
explodes very spectacularly.)

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PHLOX:
How do you feel? <br/>
ARCHER: Like a shuttlepod landed on my head. What's our status? <br/>
T'POL: We've cleared the anomalies. There is minor damage to the
starboard nacelle. Repairs should be complete within an hour. <br/>
PHLOX: You suffered a mild concussion. I'd like to keep you overnight
for observation. <br/>
ARCHER: All right, Doctor. <br/>(Phlox leaves them.) <br/>
T'POL: You could have been seriously injured. I told you to leave me
behind. <br/>
ARCHER: Fortunately, I don't take orders from you. <br/>
T'POL: I believe you wanted to see this.<br/>
ARCHER: Rosemary's Baby? <br/>
T'POL: You were obviously looking forward to it, and since you're not
going to be able to attend tonight. <br/>
ARCHER: Thanks. Would you mind bringing me another pillow? <br/>(She does.)
<br/>ARCHER: Would you turn down the lights just a little? <br/>
T'POL: Anything else? <br/>
ARCHER: You know, you'd make a wonderful nurse.</font> </p>
