at making movies.
They're not so good at fighting. Some day, I will go to Hollywood and I
will meet Betty Grable. Maybe you will introduce me, huh? What do you

We must go on. It must be world anarchy or world order. <br/>
HOSHI: That was Winston Churchill. I picked that up half an hour ago. <br/>
REED: Well, it's true then. We're over two hundred years in the past. <br/>
HOSHI: I've also intercepted several military dispatches and their
radio programme, something called The Shadow. <br/>
T'POL: We should run a complete diagnostic. Start with the sensor
array. <br/>
TUCKER: This isn't a damn sensor glitch. We just pulled three fifty
calibre bullets from the shuttlepod hull. And spare us the official
Vulcan position about time travel. We are two hundred years in the
past. Face it. <br/>
T'POL: The first step to getting back is ascertaining how we got here.
As soon as the diagnostic
is complete, run a scan for any anomalies in the area. <br/>

GHRATH: The Germans believe there are five thousand resistance fighters
operating throughout the region.
They're becoming better organized, increasing their attacks. We lost
four men in the assault. <br/>
VOSK: You should have chosen a safer route, and you should have
personally overseen the transfer. <br/>
GHRATH: We were in the midst of a crucial weapons test. He was just an
American prisoner. <br/>
VOSK: He was more than that. This communication device he was carrying.
It's from the future. <br/>
GHRATH: A temporal agent? <br/>
VOSK: Double the security details at all the entrances to the compound.
If they have located us, it won't be long before they strike. <br/>
GHRATH: How could they have possibly found us? <br/>
VOSK: If the prisoner hadn't escaped, we might know the answer to that
question. You know what I expect of you. <br/>
GHRATH: The prisoner will be recovered. </font></p>

TUCKER: You got a second? I wanted to say, I was way out of line
earlier. You have enough to worry about without me flying off the
handle. <br/>
T'POL: Your reaction was understandable. <br/>
TUCKER: I was just all set to get home. I wasn't expecting to be in the
middle of another situation. <br/>
T'POL: None of us were. I was also looking forward to going home. I
thought perhaps I would return to Vulcan. It's been some time since I
was there. <br/>
TUCKER: Sounds nice. I was gonna lay on a different beach every week
for two months. The only thing to figure out was whether to start in
Tahiti or in Cancun. The Captain would always try to put the best light
on the worst situation. I wonder what he'd say to this one. <br/>
T'POL: I think he'd be hard-pressed to find any positive aspects. But
he would try, nevertheless. (door chime) Come in. <br/>
REED: I've been going over those military dispatches that Hoshi picked
up. Some of them don't make sense. They mention recent battles in
Virginia and Ohio. There weren't any battles fought there in World War
II. The Nazis never got to North America. Something's very wrong down
there. </font></p>

a Denobulan lullaby will improve your mood? On the other hand, my

you up a little. War's a dirty business. But you're lucky. Bullet just

ARCHER: I was in a truck with a couple of German soldiers. There was an
explosion, someone
started shooting at us. I got away. <br/>
ALICIA: You sure did. And your SS friends, they're dead, which is how I
like them. You're my first bona fide POW. I usually fix up guys in the
resistance. (Archer tries to sit up) Easy. Easy, easy, easy, sailor.
You don't want to start bleeding again. <br/>
ARCHER: Sailor? <br/>
ALICIA: That patch on your shirt says Enterprise. You must have made it
off before it sank. How'd you wind up all the way over here? <br/>
ARCHER: I've been asking myself the same question. (goes to look out of
the broken window. The street scene is of German soldiers, piles of
smouldering rubbish, and trucks passing by) What year is this? <br/>
ALICIA: It's 1944. <br/>
ARCHER: World War Two. <br/>
ALICIA: I haven't heard it called that before, but that's as good a
description as any.
Used to be a pretty nice neighbourhood, even for coloureds. As you can
see, it's gone downhill. <br/></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Archer sees the remains of the 'Stop 'n' Go Cleaners.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

VOSK: The weapon fires a modulating plasma pulse equivalent to the
energy produced by three eighty eight millimetre shells.
Each pulse can destroy a tank. <br/>
GENERAL: (human) Very impressive. When can we expect deployment? <br/>
VOSK: I can't give you a specific timetable. There are still some
problems to be addressed. <br/>
GENERAL: Such as? <br/>
VOSK: Portability. The weapons require considerable power. In my
century, there are energy cells the size of a coin. In this century,
it's somewhat more difficult. (hands over a folder) <br/>
GENERAL: What are these? <br/>
VOSK: Requisition forms. I require additional supplies. <br/>
GENERAL: (reading) Eighty six metric tons of aluminum plating, a
hundred and seventy tons of carbon steel.
We can't keep diverting vital materials from war production! <br/>
VOSK: We are inside the home of a former American President. It seems
to me your war effort is going well enough. <br/>
GENERAL: That could change, very quickly. Intelligence suggests the
Americans are preparing a counterattack.
Our front lines are dangerously thin, supply routes are under constant
attack from resistance fighters.
A forceful enemy thrust could stand a good chance of breaking through.
On top of this, there've been setbacks in Africa, and the Russians are
attempting to retake Moscow.
Though no one has expressed this to the Fuhrer, there is widespread
belief that Germany has advanced
too far, too quickly. <br/>
VOSK: All the more reason to accede to my request. The weapons I'm
preparing will make you immune
from any counterattack, anywhere in the world, and I'm not just
referring to plasma rifles.
Imagine a plague targeting non-Aryans. No need for extermination camps.
Just a few grams of a pathogen
introduced into the water supply. <br/>
GENERAL: You make promises. All we ever see are films! <br/>
VOSK: There's far too much at stake for us to argue. We have far too
much in common.
We both embrace the ideals of purity and perfection, and we both face
enemies that would destroy us.
Now is not the time to end an association that is vital to our mutual
survival. <br/>
GENERAL: No one has proposed ending anything. <br/>

still alive. I doubt he'll live more than 24 hours. <br/>

also be the only hope of getting back to our own time. It is imperative

ALICIA: Yeah, tell him what you guys did before the war. <br/>
SAL: Nothing to tell. We were delegates for the Construction Workers

ALICIA: Right. The loan-sharkinq was just a part-time job. <br/>

CARMINE: Talk! <br/>
JOE: The man comes to me for information. Sometimes he asks about the
resistance, sometimes he asks
about the Gestapo. He's keeping tabs on both sides. Me? I don't know

him once. He ain't like nobody

me once. <br/>

time travel. He escaped into the past. We eventually located him, but
it was too late. He returned to my century. He and his people defeated
us and launched this war that's destroying all of time. I've sent you
to this point because it's here that Vosk can be stopped. If you
succeed, the war will never happen. The timeline will be restored. <br/>
ARCHER: One of his people told me they were building a conduit. <br/>
DANIELS: Vosk's time travel device had a drawback. It was a one-way
trip. He needed to construct the conduit to get home, but he was forced
to use technology from this time period. The machine would have to be
enormous. Find it. Destroy it. He must not succeed. Stop him. <br/>(Daniels dies.) </font></p>
