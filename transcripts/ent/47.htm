HOSHI: Feeding time? <br/>
PHLOX: When isn't it? <br/>(He takes a bundle of fluff out of a box.) <br/>
HOSHI: What is that? <br/>
PHLOX: It won't bite. It's called a tribble. <br/>(She takes it.) <br/>PHLOX: It was
extremely difficult to acquire. They're outlawed on most worlds. <br/>
HOSHI: Why? Is it dangerous? <br/>
PHLOX: Oh, far from it. All it's capable of doing, really, is eating
and breeding. The problem is they breed quite prodigiously. <br/>(Phlox takes it
from her and drops it into another cage, where, amid much screeching,
trembling of foliage and rattling of the bars, we assume it gets eaten.)
<br/>PHLOX: The only thing that keeps their population in check is the abundance of
reptiles on their homeworld. Are you feeling all right, Ensign? <br/>
HOSHI: I just came by to give you this transmission. It's from the
Denobulan Science Academy. Marked urgent. <br/>

These caverns go on for fifty kilometres. <br/>
PHLOX: They've mapped fifty kilometres. No one knows exactly how far
they extend. <br/>
TUCKER: What were these scientists of yours doing down there? <br/>
PHLOX: This cave system is known for its mineral formations. The
speleothems are supposed to be particularly unusual. <br/>
ARCHER: They've been underground for six months. The Denobulan Science
Academy lost contact with them three weeks ago. The planet's called
Xantoras. The government's been politically unstable for several years.
In the last few weeks a militant faction has taken control. <br/>
PHLOX: They're demanding that all off-worlders leave. Anyone who fails
to comply could face imprisonment, or possibly worse. <br/>
REED: Then why don't the Denobulans evacuate their own scientists? <br/>
ARCHER: They can't get here in time. Enterprise is less than a day
away. We've been asked to pick them up. First we have to find them.
You've had some caving experience. <br/>
TRAVIS: There are some pretty steep inclines here, but I think I can
handle it. <br/>
ARCHER: What about you and Malcolm? <br/>
TUCKER: Don't worry, Captain. I'm sure Travis is an excellent teacher. <br/>
ARCHER: Get some gear together. <br/>

issued a general order. You have to get them out of there in three

TUCKER: That's not much time. <br/>

emergency. <br/>
HOSHI: Their reactor casings ruptured. The Captain's asking the
Xantoras for permission to go back down. <br/>
ARCHER: Can you put it on speaker? <br/>
ALIEN [OC]: Several compartments have flooded with radiation. I have
injured passengers and crew. <br/>
XANTORAS [OC]: Your request has been denied. Leave orbit immediately. <br/>

XANTORAS [OC]: We're tracking your vessel. If you attempt to land, we
will commence <br/>

PHLOX: These two are doing well. His injuries were more extensive. His
body absorbed a heavy dose of radiation. I've stabilised him for now,
but he's going to need intra-cellular regeneration. <br/>(It's the one Phlox
stared at.) <br/>

PHLOX: Our two species have a complicated history. We've gone to war
with the Antarans on several occasions. <br/>
ARCHER: Recently? <br/>
PHLOX: On the contrary. It's been three hundred years since our last
conflict. <br/>
ARCHER: And there's still bad blood between you? <br/>
PHLOX: They've been particularly bitter disputes. <br/>
ARCHER: If you explain to him that he won't survive without your help,
maybe he'd set the past aside for a few hours. <br/>
PHLOX: I seriously doubt it. He insisted I leave the room. I don't
think you realise how much bad blood there is. <br/>
ARCHER: You could always sedate him and perform the treatment. <br/>
PHLOX: I have to respect his wishes. <br/>
ARCHER: Even if he wishes to die? <br/>
PHLOX: The will of the patient is the cornerstone of Denobulan medical
ethics. <br/>
ARCHER: Don't you believe if you can help someone your ethically bound
to do so? <br/>
PHLOX: Hippocrates wasn't Denobulan. <br/>
ARCHER: This is an Earth ship, Doctor. I won't let that man die in my
Sickbay if it can be prevented. <br/>
PHLOX: Without his consent, there is nothing I can do. <br/>

How are you feeling? <br/>
HUDAK: I'd like to return to my ship. <br/>
ARCHER: Your ship was damaged by the reactor leak. It'll be a few days
before you can go back aboard. You were exposed to high levels of
radiation. You need treatment. <br/>
HUDAK: I prefer to be treated by another physician. <br/>
ARCHER: If you don't let Phlox operate, you won't survive more than two
days. I understand there's a troubled history between your peoples, but
I can assure you Phlox is an excellent doctor. <br/>
HUDAK: Our history is much more than troubled. Did your doctor tell you
that their battle tactics resulted in twenty million Antaran
casualties? <br/>
ARCHER: He wasn't that specific. <br/>
HUDAK: I imagine not. They've been very successful at putting it behind
them. <br/>
ARCHER: Do you want to become a casualty of a war that ended three
hundred years ago? Phlox has been my Chief Medical Officer for nearly
two years. I've never questioned his skill or his integrity. <br/>
HUDAK: It's quite possible he's a proficient surgeon, but I don't
intend to find out. <br/>
ARCHER: You'd rather die? <br/>
HUDAK: I'm the first Antaran to even see a Denobulan in six
generations. <br/>
ARCHER: If you spent some time with him, it might change your
perception of them. <br/>
HUDAK: A few hours in our historical archives might change yours. <br/>
ARCHER: I prefer to make my judgments based on firsthand experience. I
respect your history and the sacrifice your people made, but I can tell
you that the Denobulans you're describing are not the people I've met.

Why haven't you ever mentioned this? <br/>
PHLOX It wasn't our proudest moment, but we've done our best to put it
behind us. <br/>
ARCHER: Do you know you're the first Denobulan he's ever met? <br/>
PHLOX: And he is the first Antaran I've ever met. <br/>
ARCHER: Doesn't that seem odd to you? That in three hundred years
neither side has tried to reconcile. Maybe you put it behind you too
quickly. <br/>
PHLOX: As I said before, the situation is complicated. From childhood,
every Antaran is taught that Denobulans are enemies to be feared,
reviled. <br/>
ARCHER: This is your chance to prove them wrong. <br/>
PHLOX: I doubt I could. <br/>
ARCHER: Set aside your preconceptions. I made some headway with him,
but I won't be the one holding the scalpel. Show him that he can trust
you. <br/>
PHLOX: Do you believe I can earn his trust in less than thirty six
hours? <br/>

treating him against his will, but nothing's stopping you from talking
to him. You're a doctor. He's your patient. Find a way to help him. </font></p>

life. Some friends and I had planned the journey for months, but the
week before I was supposed to leave one of my grandmothers took me

and getting stuck in lava tubes all just to find you. Now, I've got an
injured man waiting for us and we have just enough time to get out of
here before we end up in front of a Xantoras firing squad. My orders
are to bring you back, and I promise you that's what I'm going to do. <br/>
YOLEN: You can't force us to leave. <br/>
TUCKER: Want to bet? We didn't risk our lives to hear you say, thanks,
but no thanks. So pack up whatever you need because I swear, I'll tie
you up and drag you out by your ankles if that's how you want it. <br/>
YOLEN: We have a lot of samples. We'll need your help. <br/>

I'd prefer to spend my last few days alone. <br/>
PHLOX: That's your decision, but if my knowledge of Antaran lifespans
is correct, your last days won't come for about sixty years. <br/>
HUDAK: What are you talking about? <br/>

able to <br/>
HUDAK: I refused your treatment. <br/>
PHLOX: I need to take you off the pain medication before I begin the
procedure. <br/>
HUDAK: Get away from me. I was told your principles prevented you from
treating me against my will. Or don't your ethics apply to Antarans? <br/>
PHLOX: I did have nightmares. <br/>
HUDAK: What? <br/>
PHLOX: You asked me if I had heard stories as a child about the
Antarans. My grandmother lived through the last war. I would lay in my
bed at night thinking about her stories, terrified that one of those
evil Antarans would climb through my window. <br/>
HUDAK: I hope your confession makes you feel better, Doctor, but it
doesn't change a thing. <br/>
PHLOX: You also asked me if I have children. I have five. And no, I
never told them my grandmother's stories. When they asked me about the
Antarans, I told them the truth, as best as I knew it. I told them
about our military campaigns against your people. About how we had
demonised you, turned you into a faceless enemy. I wanted them to learn
to judge people for what they really are, not what the propaganda tells
them. <br/>
HUDAK: How would you know who we really are? <br/>
PHLOX: I don't. But I'm proud to say that my children would consider my
grandmother's attitude archaic. All of them but one. We have grown more
open-minded since the last war, but there are still Denobulans who fear
Antarans, even hate them. My youngest son, Mettus, was seduced by those
people. I did my best to convince him he was mistaken. I told him I
wouldn't tolerate the values he was embracing. It created a rift
between us. Maybe I didn't do enough to reach him. Last time we spoke
was nearly ten years ago. You wanted to know what my children would
think if they were here now. I can tell you what Mettus would think. He
would be happy to have me grant your request and let you die. But that
is not the example I tried to set for my children. Why not live and set
an example for yours? </font></p>
