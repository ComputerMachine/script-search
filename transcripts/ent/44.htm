look alive to me. <br/>

ARCHER: That's what I was about to ask you. <br/>
TUCKER: I think I was up on the ceiling with those things. I was
looking down at the three of us, but not with my eyes. I can't explain
it. <br/>
ARCHER: We should get him back to the ship. <br/>
TUCKER: I was in Tarpon Springs, too, swimming with Lisa. She was
afraid it was getting too dark. <br/>

happening. <br/>

TUCKER: Yes. It's all very good. Have you ever tried this? <br/>
ARCHER: It's called bread. You've never eaten it before? <br/>
TUCKER: I've never eaten anything before. <br/>
T'POL: Where's Commander Tucker? <br/>
TUCKER: I'm here. Charles Tucker III. <br/>
ARCHER: Where's the man who used to be Charles Tucker? <br/>
TUCKER: He's exploring another realm. My realm. But he'll be back. <br/>
ARCHER: I want him back now. <br/>
TUCKER: Please trust me. He's experiencing things he never thought he
could. <br/>
ARCHER: Where is he? <br/>
TUCKER: It's not a question of where. He's no longer corporeal. But he
will be again, I assure you. <br/>
REED: When we were outside, we saw a wisp of vapour penetrate him. Did
you have anything to do with that? <br/>
TUCKER: Wisp. Interesting word. Wisp. Wisp. Yes, I suppose you could
call us that. Wisp. <br/>
ARCHER: Where do you come from? <br/>
TUCKER: We live in subspace. We travel through it. We're explorers,
like you. <br/>
ARCHER: Why did you take Commander Tucker? <br/>
TUCKER: It's been a long time since we've encountered corporeal beings.
After we performed the first crossing with your commander, we realised
we were compatible. You're very interesting. Trapped in bodies that
need maintenance. You have gender. You require mates to reproduce. You
eat food. We were like you once, but we evolved. Now we can learn how
our ancestors lived. <br/>
ARCHER: I want my crewman, and I want my ship released. <br/>
REED: Captain. <br/>(Through the porthole, we see the ship is moving.) <br/>
TUCKER: Your crewman will be returned. You claim to be an explorer,
Captain. Open your mind to new possibilities. <br/>
(Enterprise is released into space.) <br/>
ARCHER: What about Tucker? <br/>
TUCKER: I've enjoyed my time with you. <br/>
REED: Sir. <br/>
(A yellow wisp enters the Mess hall, then Tucker, and a blue one
leaves.) <br/>
TUCKER: Wow. <br/>
ARCHER: Wow what? <br/>
TUCKER: I was riding right alongside Hopalong Cassidy chasing some bad
guys. Then I was with Lisa again, except this time we were snow sailing
in New Zealand. Then I was eight years old, maybe nine, picking up
leaves with my dad. But it wasn't a dream, Captain. It was as real as
I'm sitting here. They told me you can try it. Anyone on the crew. <br/>
ARCHER: Who told you? <br/>
TUCKER: They did. The ones I was with. <br/>
ARCHER: I thought you were with Hopalong Cassidy and your girlfriend. <br/>
TUCKER: I was, but it's hard to explain. You should try it. You'll
understand what I'm talking about. You all should try it. <br/>
ARCHER: Take him to Sickbay. <br/>
TUCKER: Captain, I'm fine. <br/>
ARCHER: We'll let the Doctor decide how fine you are. <br/>
REED: Commander. <br/>(Reed and Tucker leave.) <br/>
ARCHER: Something smells funny. <br/>
T'POL: They've released the ship and Commander Tucker. They've done
everything you've asked. Have you considered they may have been telling
the truth when they said they were just curious about us? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ready room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Now that
the Doctor's given Trip a clean bill of health, my primary concern is
to get Enterprise out of here. But Trip tells me it'll be awhile before
he can get the engines online. From what we can tell, these life forms
have no mass. Non-corporeal beings. that's got to be a first for
Starfleet. T'Pol thinks they just want to get to know us. Maybe she's
right. Maybe I don't trust them because they're so different. I'd hate
to think that was the case. (doorbell chime) Computer, pause. Come in. <br/>
PHLOX: I hope I'm not disturbing you. <br/>
ARCHER: Everything all right? <br/>
PHLOX: I'm not certain. One of those beings appeared in Sickbay a few
minutes ago. It entered me right here. <br/>(Phlox indicates his forehead.) <br/>PHLOX: But my
physiology must not have been compatible. It left almost immediately. <br/>
ARCHER: Are you sure you're all right? <br/>
PHLOX: I'm fine. But it was disturbing. The lifeform was trying very
hard to reach me.<br/>(In the Armoury, Reed spots the reflection of a blue wisp in a
fixture, and makes a dash for it. He tries shooting at it, but of
course that has no effect. It catches him in a corridor, where he has

REED: If you'd allow the crossing, you'd find out. <br/>

male. Wouldn't that be helpful to you? <br/>

wish for. It would be a shame not to take advantage of that. <br/>

HOSHI: It would be best if they stayed where they were. <br/>

HOSHI: We're offering them a great opportunity. They may never get
another chance to experience existence as we do. <br/>
ARCHER: Security to the Bridge. You're taking over my crew. Why? <br/>
HOSHI: I understand how you may be frightened by all this. Losing your
substance, existing as perceptive energy, but you'll be grateful once
you've made the crossing, I promise you. <br/>
ARCHER: We're kind of fond of our substance. We're not very anxious to
give it up. <br/>
HOSHI: Those who've preceded you are safe and happy. They'll
understand. <br/>

T'POL: We need to learn more about these life forms. <br/>
ARCHER: What we need is to get our people back. <br/>
T'POL: It's illogical to believe we can do that without learning more
about the aliens' intentions. <br/>
ARCHER: Do you have something in mind? <br/>
T'POL: I'd like your permission to leave the catwalk. <br/>
ARCHER: You wouldn't have a chance. One of those things would take you
before you got back to the saucer section. <br/>
T'POL: Not necessarily. If a lifeform attempts to exchange its
consciousness with mine, I believe I can prevent it. <br/>
ARCHER: What makes you think that? <br/>
T'POL: No offence, Captain, but the Vulcan mind is far more disciplined
that yours. It can resist temptations, emotions, and I believe,
invasions by these lifeforms. <br/>
ARCHER: Even if you're right, what would you accomplish? <br/>
T'POL: If an alien attempts this transfer, there may be a brief period
when our minds are conjoined. It's possible I can ascertain their
motives. <br/>
ARCHER: It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it. <br/>
T'POL: There's no other choice. <br/>
ARCHER: And if you're wrong? <br/>
T'POL: It's a risk I'm willing to take. <br/>
ARCHER: Well, I'm not. They've already taken twenty four people. I'm
not going to give them another one. <br/>

another suggestion. </font></p>
