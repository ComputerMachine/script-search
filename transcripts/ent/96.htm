<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(In San Francisco, Starfleet is acting as a
conference centre where representatives from several worlds are seated
around a large horse-shoe shaped table, listening to a speech by a
human. It is being taped by the press, and there are also spectators,
including the Enterprise crew standing on a staircase.) <br/>
SAMUELS: Having endured a catastrophic World War, Earth's governments
came to this city for the purpose of creating a just and lasting peace
among nations. Today, we have assembled here again, representatives of
numerous worlds, to forge an unprecedented alliance. With this
Coalition of Planets, we seek to strengthen our bonds of friendship,
render permanent the peace that now exists among us for the ongoing
exploration of our galaxy. Let us dedicate ourselves to these worthy
goals so that future generations can look back upon this moment with
pride and eternal gratitude. Thank you. <br/>

ARCHER: People are watching. <br/>
TUCKER: Nobody knows that better than him. <br/>
ARCHER: Clap louder. That's an order. <br/>
PHLOX: I thought it was a fine speech. <br/>
TRAVIS: Just missing a few names. <br/>
REED: You'd think this was all his idea. <br/>
HOSHI: It's not about who gets credit. <br/>
TUCKER: He could've at least mentioned Enterprise. Who does he think
got the Andorians and Tellarites talking? <br/>
T'POL: I'm sure history will reflect our contribution. <br/>
TUCKER: Not if he's writing it. <br/>
ARCHER: That's enough. <br/>

SAMUELS: I hope I didn't embarrass myself too much. <br/>
ARCHER: Far from it, Minister. <br/>
SAMUELS: Call me Nathan. I want to thank you again for attending.
Having Enterprise here seems to put everyone at ease. People feel
comfortable in the presence of heroes. <br/>
ARCHER: Whatever we can do to help. <br/>
SAMUELS: Well, it certainly helps that the delegates can understand
each other. These universal translators work perfectly, thanks to you. <br/>
HOSHI: I just updated them with a few things we picked up on the
mission. <br/>
SAMUELS: Whatever you did, they're extremely precise. Though, when I'm
listening to the Tellarite ambassador, I wish they were just a little
less precise. <br/>
T'POL: You've set a formidable goal. The drafting of a charter in six
weeks? <br/>
SAMUELS: I've always believed that formidable goals produce formidable
results. <br/>
(Meanwhile, a lady member of the press meets up with Travis.) <br/>
GANNET: I decided to stop waiting. <br/>
TRAVIS: For what? <br/>
GANNET: You to come over and say hello. <br/>
TRAVIS: You were busy working. <br/>
GANNET: We never had a problem mixing work and pleasure. Smile. I never
could get you to smile for the camera. <br/>
TRAVIS: How have you been, Gannet? <br/>
GANNET: Busy. There haven't been many slow news days since the Xindi
attack. I hear you're going to be in the neighborhood awhile. <br/>
TRAVIS: At least until the conference is over. <br/>
GANNET: We should get together. If we wait another four years, we're
going to have too much catching up to do. <br/>
TRAVIS: Can't argue with that. <br/>
GANNET: I'll pretend that was an enthusiastic yes. Back to work. <br/>
(They split up and we watch a pale woman in a coat come into the
conference without a security badge.) <br/>
T'POL: Commander Tucker does have a point. Enterprise laid the
foundation for this event. Perhaps it should be you they're
photographing. <br/>
ARCHER: Samuels likes the spotlight, and he's welcome to it. <br/>
KHOURI: They're going to kill her. <br/>

The wound was too severe. She didn't survive. <br/>
REED: Do they think it could have been self-inflicted? <br/>
PHLOX: They didn't say. Do we know who she was? <br/>
T'POL: Her name was Susan Khouri. She was a medical technician. She'd
been having some emotional trouble. Took a leave from work over a year
ago. <br/>
TUCKER: Any idea who the hair belonged to? <br/>
PHLOX: I have a very good idea. <br/>(He goes to the main monitor.) <br/>PHLOX: It was from
a child no more than six months old. I used every DNA identification
protocol I'm aware of. I even used a Klingon procedure. <br/>
ARCHER: Go ahead. <br/>
PHLOX: It contains Vulcan and human DNA. I had the computer search for
any matches in the Starfleet databank. When I got the results, I ran
the search three more times just to be certain. <br/>
ARCHER: And? <br/>
PHLOX: According to every analysis, this child is the offspring of
Commander Tucker and Commander T'Pol. </font></p>

TUCKER: We got to talk about this. <br/>
T'POL: It's difficult to talk about something that doesn't make sense. <br/>
TUCKER: Phlox said DNA doesn't lie. <br/>
T'POL: Neither do I. I've never been pregnant, Trip. <br/>
TUCKER: Then how do you explain all this? <br/>
T'POL: I can't. Do you believe me? <br/>
TUCKER: Yeah. Phlox must be wrong, that's all there is to it. If you've
never been pregnant, then you can't have a baby. <br/>
T'POL: Trip, the moment Phlox said that the child was ours, I knew it
was true. <br/>
TUCKER: But you said you'd never been <br/>
T'POL: I haven't. <br/>
TUCKER: Then what are you saying? <br/>
T'POL: I can't explain how it exists, but I know it does. There's a
child out there, and it's ours. <br/>

are flags in the corner now.) <br/>
SAMUELS: Fortunately, the news hasn't spread to the general public, and
I'd like to keep it that way. <br/>
ARCHER: If we made an announcement, someone might come forward with
information. <br/>
SAMUELS: An announcement of this nature could derail the conference. <br/>
ARCHER: How? <br/>
SAMUELS: You haven't spent much time on Earth lately. After the Xindi
attack, there was a dangerous increase in xenophobia. <br/>
ARCHER: We got a taste of it. <br/>
SAMUELS: It died down somewhat, but not completely. There are still
people out there who want us to stay in our little corner of the
galaxy. The news of a Vulcan-human hybrid could inflame them, give them
something to rally against. <br/>
ARCHER: I can't believe we're talking about more than a small minority.
<br/>
SAMUELS: As I said, you've been away for a while. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe I just have a little more faith in humanity than you do. <br/>
SAMUELS: Can't afford to operate on faith. There's more at stake here
than a simple trade agreement. You fought the Xindi. You know better
than anyone how Earth's survival depends on alliances with other
species. We don't have the Vulcans watching our backs anymore. <br/>
ARCHER: This isn't about finding someone else to watch our backs. <br/>
SAMUELS: All I'm saying is that there's strength in numbers. <br/>
ARCHER: All right. I was hoping you'd have some word on the
investigation. My Engineer and Science Officer are eager to get some
answers. <br/>
SAMUELS: I'm sure they are, but I've heard nothing new. <br/>
ARCHER: There's got to be something we can do. <br/>
SAMUELS: Starfleet investigators are more than capable of handling
this. I suggest we let them do their job. I'll notify you the moment I
hear something. I appreciate your co-operation. <br/>

HARRIS: The last time we spoke, you asked me to never contact you
again. <br/>
REED: I contacted you. Susan Khouri <br/>
HARRIS: First, we need an understanding. <br/>
REED: About what? <br/>
HARRIS: That by speaking to me, you're back in the game. Simple as
that. <br/>
REED: Who was she? <br/>
HARRIS: She was more than just an emotionally troubled nurse. She was a
member of an underground isolationist movement, Terra Prime. <br/>
REED: I've heard of them. They want to stop all contact with alien
species. <br/>
HARRIS: They believe it's corrupting our way of life. <br/>
REED: I remember they made a lot of noise back when Enterprise was
launched. <br/>
HARRIS: They had a resurgence following the Xindi attack. We think
Khouri was trying to leave the movement. <br/>
REED: That's why they killed her? <br/>
HARRIS: Her defection may have had something to do with the child. <br/>
REED: I was getting to that. <br/>
HARRIS: The child belongs to two of your crewmen. You tell me. <br/>
REED: They claim they don't know anything about it. <br/>
HARRIS: That doesn't seem likely, does it? <br/>
REED: I believe them. <br/>
HARRIS: I admire your loyalty. We think Terra Prime is involved, and
that they're planning something. <br/>
REED: You just don't know what? <br/>

we'll have the answers. </font></p>

it by now. <br/>
PAXTON: We can't be sure what she told them. Anyway, I'm more concerned
with why she turned away from us. <br/>

spent a great deal of time caring for her. <br/>

ARCHER: Susan Khouri was a member of Terra Prime. <br/>
SAMUELS: If that's true, it's extremely troubling. <br/>
ARCHER: Not as troubling as something else we learned. You were once a

SAMUELS: It seems you're doing fairly well investigating on your own. <br/>
ARCHER: That's why you wanted this kept quiet. <br/>
SAMUELS: I've already explained why there was a need for secrecy. I was
very young when I joined Terra Prime. <br/>
ARCHER: You were eighteen. <br/>
SAMUELS: Didn't you make any questionable choices when you were that
age, Captain? It was a stupid mistake. I was a fool. My father had died
in a freighter accident and I blamed the pilot, who happened to be
Denobulan. We all have our demons. I've exorcised mine. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't care what you did when you were young, Minister. I need
your help. <br/>

tests and found traces of myofibrilin. <br/>
REED: That's what they prescribe for extended zero-G missions. It's
hardly used anymore outside of military exercises. Not since the
invention of artificial gravity. <br/>
PHLOX: It is still given to workers in remote places where artificial
gravity isn't practical. <br/>
ARCHER: Like mining colonies. <br/>
T'POL: The nearest one is Orpheus, on the moon. <br/>
REED: I have heard that the moon is a hotbed of Terra Prime activity.
You know, I think Travis has a friend who worked on Orpheus. He might
be able to get a couple of us inside. We could pay a little visit,
undercover. <br/>
TUCKER: I want to be a part of that visit. <br/>
T'POL: I'd like to volunteer as well. <br/>
ARCHER: Tell Travis to see what he can do. <br/>
REED: Yes, sir.<br/>(At the Orpheus Mining Facility he workers have air in the mine, but they're
lifting and moving rocks by hand for some strange reason. Then they
discover the battered body of the doctor.)

GANNET: I'm never going to settle down. It doesn't mean I'm not going
to get serious with someone, if the right circumstance comes along. <br/>
TRAVIS: And what constitutes the right circumstance? <br/>
GANNET: I'll know it when it happens. What did you mean earlier about
reconsidering some decisions you've made? <br/>
TRAVIS: I've spent my whole life in space, going from one place to the
next. Seeing you, I was wondering, maybe the next challenge, at least
for me, is to stay in one place for a while. <br/>

million? And now those same leaders want to form a Coalition with
Tellarites, Andorians, Rigelians, Coridanites and Vulcans! Vulcans, who
not too long ago, massacred forty five humans working at the Earth
embassy! Nathan Samuels claims that future generations will look back
on this era with pride. But if things keep going the way they're going,
there won't be any future generations. At least not human. I love
humanity too much to sit by and let that happen. <br/>

found when she gets shot.) <br/>
JOSIAH: It's estimated that there are at least five thousand
unregistered aliens on Earth. Now, another study puts that figure at
ten thousand. This insanity is the direct result
of our government's policy and the enforcers of that policy, Starfleet!
We need to send a message to the people in power. And there's someone
here tonight who is going to help us do just that. Commander Tucker, of

Yes, yes, go right ahead. roam the stars. Yes, inform potentially
hostile species of the whereabouts of Earth. Yes, entrust the entire
future of our world to non-human creatures who don't even feel like we
do. Yes, promote the total degradation of mankind by encouraging
alien-human relations. Well, yes is a word that ends here and now. I'm
returning Earth to its rightful owners. I am giving Earth back to
