higher than last month. <br/>
T'POL: The treatment's no longer effective?<br/>
PHLOX: I told you it was just a matter of time before we'd need
supplemental medications. This conference is a perfect opportunity.
Some of your finest physicians will be there. It's essential that I
speak with them.<br/>
T'POL: It's too great a risk. I'd be taken off Enterprise.<br/>
PHLOX: I think I can question them without revealing that you're
infected.<br/>
T'POL: It's too great a risk.<br/>

could very possibly die. </font></p>

PHLOX: Oh, I haven't seen Feezal for nearly four years.<br/>
TUCKER: What's the point of having three wives if you never get to see
them?<br/>
PHLOX: Denobulans are renowned for their patience. <br/>(The air lock door opens

PHLOX: Captain Archer, I'd like you to meet my second wife, Feezal. <br/>
ARCHER: It's a pleasure to have you aboard. <br/>
FEEZAL: Thank you.<br/>
PHLOX: And this is our Chief Engineer, Commander Tucker.<br/>
TUCKER: Ma'am.<br/>
FEEZAL: I look forward to helping you install the microscope.<br/>
ARCHER: We can hold that off till later. I'm sure the two of you are
eager to spend some time together.<br/>
PHLOX: Nonsense, Captain. We've been apart for four years. Another
hour, another day. As I said, we're very patient.<br/>
ARCHER: Well in that case, why don't we have some lunch while the
microscope's being unloaded?<br/>
FEEZAL: I'd be honoured. <br/>(Phlox leads the way.) <br/>FEEZAL: Won't you be joining us,
Commander?<br/>
TUCKER: I'd love to, but I think I should make sure your equipment gets

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> YURIS: It seems odd, doesn't it, that a Denobulan
physician would be interested in a Vulcan disease.<br/>
PHLOX: One of my colleagues on Denobula has been studying Pa'nar
Syndrome for some time. Its pathology is quite similar to thymic
sclerosis. <br/>
STROMM: Thymic sclerosis?<br/>
PHLOX: It's a nonfatal illness which we've had very little success
treating. I promised him, my colleague back home, that I'd inquire about
any recent advances in its treatment. <br/>
ORATT: We're hesitant to discuss Pa'nar Syndrome, Doctor. This illness
is unique to a subculture, a small percentage of our population. Their
behaviour is neither tolerated nor sanctioned.<br/>
PHLOX: My friend is well aware of that. Unfortunately, thymic sclerosis
is found in all strata of Denobulan society. Developing a cure is of
paramount importance. <br/>
YURIS: Do you have any literature on this disease?<br/>
PHLOX: As I told you, I'm currently serving on a Starfleet vessel.
Humans are not susceptible to it. I could contact my colleague but it
would take at least five days before we'd receive a response.<br/>
STROMM: I'm afraid we'll have returned to Vulcan by then.<br/>
PHLOX: Anything you could provide me with would be instrumental in
helping the Denobulan people.<br/>
ORATT: We'll have to discuss your request, Doctor. When we've reached a
decision, we'll contact you aboard your ship.<br/>
PHLOX: Thank you for your time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TUCKER: If the reflectometer is supposed to
amplify the neutron stream, shouldn't it be installed before the
emitters?<br/>
FEEZAL: It's collimating the neutrons, not amplifying them. If you read
the instructions, you'll find it's all very clear.<br/>
TUCKER: Oh, I've tried to read the instructions, and they are anything
but clear. I don't want to brag, but I can take apart and put back
together just about any piece of equipment I've ever met. It's one of
the reasons Captain Archer picked me for this mission, because I'm
really good at following instructions. But these are in <br/>
FEEZAL: Denobulan. I understand. That's why I'm here. So let's go
through it slowly. Do you see the threads on the aperture ring?<br/>
TUCKER: Here.<br/>
FEEZAL: Exactly. Take the smaller condenser lens and screw it on. Now
remodulate the emitter frequency. That'll initiate the neutron stream.<br/>
TUCKER: Which one? <br/>(She is right up close against him as she leans
across to pick up a piece of equipment.) <br/>TUCKER: You're going to have to help me
with this one.<br/>
FEEZAL: It's very simple. Insert the thick end into this opening. It'll
automatically programme the frequency. You can pull it out now. The
stream should be initiated.<br/>
TUCKER: I think I'm getting the hang of it. Maybe if you explain the
next few steps, I could try and get through some of this on my own.
<br/>(He makes a little distance between them.) <br/>
FEEZAL: By all means. You're a very confident young man, aren't you?<br/>
TUCKER: I try to be.<br/>
FEEZAL: You're going to need to come a little closer to see this. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: Have you spoken to Phlox since he got back?<br/>
T'POL: I wasn't aware he was gone.<br/>
ARCHER: You must've not seen him yesterday morning. He was champing at
the bit to get down to that conference. Brought back a wish list of
medical instruments. <br/>
T'POL: It is the first I.M.E. conference he's attended in over a year.<br/>
ARCHER: He said there was a Vulcan contingent. You might want to go
down for a visit. You may know one of them.<br/>
T'POL: There are over one million physicians on Vulcan.<br/>
ARCHER: I would think you'd enjoy spending time with members of your
own species. (comm. beep) Archer.<br/>
HOSHI [OC]: A Vulcan transport has requested permission to dock, sir.
They've already left the surface.<br/>
ARCHER: Speak of the devil. Looks like you won't have to go anywhere.
I'll meet them at Docking port two.<br/>
HOSHI [OC]: They've asked that the doctor join you, and Sub-Commander
T'Pol.<br/>
ARCHER: Let him know, okay?<br/>
HOSHI [OC]: Right away, sir. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The three Vulcan doctors sit down along one side
of a table.) <br/>
ARCHER: Can I get you something? Thanks to Sub-Commander T'Pol, our
chef has learned to make some pretty decent Plomeek soup.<br/>
ORATT: We appreciate your hospitality, Captain, but we've come to speak
to your doctor, with your permission.<br/>
ARCHER: Absolutely. If you need anything, just let me know. <br/>(He turns to
leave.) <br/>
ORATT: We would appreciate it if T'Pol would remain.<br/>
ARCHER: Sub-Commander. <br/>
(Phlox and T'Pol sit opposite the Vulcans, as Archer leaves.) <br/>
ORATT: We've discussed your request. Unfortunately, we are still
hesitant to share data regarding Pa'nar Syndrome.<br/>
PHLOX: Sub-Commander T'Pol is not aware of my request. I'm curious why
you asked her to stay.<br/>YURIS: You're requesting information about a Vulcan disease, and you
didn't discuss it with your Vulcan Science Officer?<br/>
PHLOX: That's correct. As far as I know, her expertise does not include
medicine.<br/>
ORATT: Are you familiar with Pa'nar Syndrome, Sub-Commander?<br/>
T'POL: Of course.<br/>
ORATT: Would you mind describing it?<br/>
T'POL: You are physicians. Why would you need me to define an illness?<br/>
ORATT: Please, indulge us.<br/>
T'POL: It's an incurable degradation of the synaptic pathways. It also
affects the endocrine and immune systems.<br/>
STROMM: An impressive definition. Could you tell us how the disease is
transmitted?<br/>
T'POL: Through a telepathic practice.<br/>
ORATT: And what practice would that be?<br/>
T'POL: Mind-melds. They cause a disruption of neuroelectric impulses in
the mid-brain, which can lead to the early stages of the syndrome. <br/>
STROMM: Do you condone these acts, Sub-Commander? These mind-melds?<br/>
T'POL: I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me why you asked me here. <br/>
PHLOX: As would I. Your questions to T'Pol seem inappropriate.<br/>
ORATT: Doctor Phlox has asked for data regarding the treatment of
Pa'nar Syndrome. Did you have anything to do with that request?<br/>
PHLOX: I believe I was very clear about that.<br/>
STROMM: Yes, your colleague on Denobula. Forgive us Doctor, but since
there's a Vulcan serving on your ship, a fact that you neglected to
mention to us, we had to consider other possible motives for you
inquiry.<br/>
PHLOX: What motive are you suggesting?</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Stromm hands a PADD to T'Pol.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
STROMM: Are you familiar with any of these
names? <br/>
T'POL: They're Vulcan. I'm not familiar with any of them.<br/>
STROMM: They're melders. Vulcans with the ability to transfer thoughts
and memories to each other. Do you know any melders, Sub-Commander?<br/>
T'POL: Not well, but I've met a number of them.<br/>
STROMM: Then I'll ask you again. Do you condone their behaviour?<br/>
T'POL: I don't understand what your questions have to do with the
Doctor's request.<br/>
ORATT: We find their behaviour unacceptable, and since Pa'nar Syndrome
is transmitted by these people, its cure is not a priority.<br/>
PHLOX: Are you saying there is no additional research?<br/>
ORATT: None that we'd care to disseminate. I'm sorry.<br/>
T'POL: You travelled up from the surface to tell Doctor Phlox you
wouldn't help him?<br/>
ORATT: If you'll please show us to the airlock. </font></p>

TUCKER: Amazing. Look at that. Are those?<br/>
FEEZAL: Carbon atoms. Now you try it.<br/>
TUCKER: First I reinitialise the neutron stream.<br/>
FEEZAL: Precisely. Very good. Now align the quantum filters.<br/>

TUCKER: Oh, not you. The microscope.<br/>

FEEZAL: Absolutely not. Groznik has only apologised twice. I doubt
he'll be forgiven for another two years.<br/>
PHLOX: Well, at least he has his other wives.<br/>
FEEZAL: Not wives, wife. Kessil moved to Teerza Prime to be with her
third husband.<br/>
TUCKER: Did I do this right? Why is there no image?<br/>

(Phlox and T'Pol enter.) <br/>
PHLOX: Yes, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: I wanted to see both of you. It's been a while since I was
embarrassed by a Vulcan dignitary.<br/>
PHLOX: Sir?<br/>
ARCHER: I just spoke to Doctor Oratt. It seems you requested some
medical data regarding a Vulcan illness for a colleague on Denobula.<br/>
PHLOX: Yes, sir.<br/>
ARCHER: And both of you said that T'Pol had nothing to do with that
request. Are you both going to lie to me like you lied to them?<br/>
PHLOX: I have no intention of lying to you, Captain.<br/>
ARCHER: And when were you going to tell me that you've contracted a
serious illness?<br/>
T'POL: Sir?<br/>
ARCHER: They handed you something. A PADD, I think. Does that ring a
bell? You left a fingerprint. It was enough for them to run tests. Why
did you lie to them?<br/>
T'POL: It's none of their concern.<br/>
ARCHER: It sure as hell is if they can help you. (to Phlox) How long
have you known about this?<br/>
PHLOX: Nearly a year.<br/>
ARCHER: And you never thought that maybe you should come to me and let
me know that one of my officers has a potentially fatal disease?<br/>
PHLOX: I believe your culture embraces the concept of doctor-patient
confidentiality. <br/>
T'POL: The disease is not contagious. If we had told you there's
nothing you could have done.<br/>
ARCHER: You still haven't explained to me why you lied to the Vulcans.
And why would you think they would be more apt to help you if you said
it was for a Denobulan colleague?<br/>
PHLOX: Pa'nar syndrome is an illness that carries a stigma on Vulcan. <br/>
T'POL: If the High Command was to learn that I was infected, I would
most likely lose my commission.<br/>
ARCHER: For having a disease?<br/>
T'POL: It's not about the disease. It's about the people who are
capable of transmitting it.<br/>
ARCHER: Go on.<br/>
T'POL: There are certain Vulcans, a small minority, who are born with
the ability to perform a very intimate form of telepathy.<br/>
ARCHER: Intimate?<br/>
T'POL: A melding of minds.<br/>
ARCHER: That ship of Vulcans who were experimenting with emotions. <br/>
T'POL: They are part of the telepathic minority. One of the reasons why
they left Vulcan was to escape prejudice. Their behaviour is considered
unnatural. They're seen as a threat. <br/>
ARCHER: You belong to that minority? <br/>
T'POL: No.<br/>
ARCHER: Then?<br/>
PHLOX: Only members of the minority can initiate a mind-meld, but any
Vulcan can be the recipient.<br/>
ARCHER: Why would you take that risk?<br/>
T'POL: It wasn't by choice. One of the men on that ship.<br/>
ARCHER: You were attacked. I remember. I'm sure the High Command will
understand.<br/>
T'POL: I have no intention of telling them.<br/>
ARCHER: Why not?<br/>
T'POL: I have my reasons.<br/>
ARCHER: How serious is it?<br/>
PHLOX: I've kept it in check, but the symptoms have progressed. That's
why I requested the most current research.<br/>
ARCHER: Well, your request was accompanied by a lie, and whatever your
reasons might have been, you're no longer welcome at the conference.
The Vulcans have seen to that.<br/>
PHLOX: I understand.<br/>
ARCHER: My number one priority here is the health of my first officer.
If these doctors have data that can help her, I plan to get it. <br/>

STROMM: I'm sorry, did we keep you waiting?<br/>
ARCHER: Actually, you did.<br/>
STROMM: What can we do for you, Captain?<br/>
ARCHER: Sub-Commander T'Pol and my doctor have explained the situation
to me.<br/>
STROMM: It's unfortunate that T'Pol is ill.<br/>
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox assures me that he was only trying to protect her
privacy. He doesn't make a habit of lying. <br/>
STROMM: I certainly hope not.<br/>
ARCHER: I'm having a little difficulty understanding why you won't
share your research, especially now that you know it could help T'Pol's
condition. I can't believe you're withholding it to punish Doctor Phlox.<br/>
STROMM: Our decision has nothing to do with that.<br/>
ARCHER: Then what does it have to do with?<br/>
STROMM: Pa'nar syndrome is a disease that's unique to an undesirable
segment of our population. Thankfully, there are very few of them.<br/>
ARCHER: And because you find them undesirable they're not entitled to
medical care?<br/>
STROMM: We don't condone the intimate acts that these people engage in.
They defy everything our society stands for.<br/>
ARCHER: Intimate acts? You're talking about mind-melds.<br/>
STROMM: We take great pride in our ability to contain emotions. Sharing
them is offensive. Now if you'll excuse me, we have a great deal of
work to do before the conference ends.<br/>
ARCHER: If you're not going to help her the least you could do is show
a little discretion. The High Command doesn't need to know about this.<br/>
STROMM: It's not for us to decide what the High Command needs to know.<br/>
ARCHER: You have her genetic profile. You must realise she's not a
member of this minority.<br/>

FEEZAL: Ensign Sato barely has an
accent. She was telling me how attractive she thinks you are.<br/>
HOSHI: She's pulling your leg, sir. I was only talking about grammar.<br/>
TUCKER: It's okay, Hoshi.<br/>
HOSHI: I've got to go. It was very nice to meet you. <br/>(Hoshi leaves.)<br/>
FEEZAL: I wasn't exactly pulling your leg, was I?<br/>
TUCKER: No, not exactly. Look, I'm very flattered, but aren't you a
married woman?<br/>
FEEZAL: I'm a woman. That's all that matters, isn't it?<br/>
TUCKER: I'm afraid I've got to go, too. Captain asked me to write a
synopsis of tonight's movie.<br/>
FEEZAL: Save me a seat.<br/>
TUCKER: You probably wouldn't like it. It's very scary, and you've got
to. You've got to be human to appreciate horror films. I'll see you in
the morning.<br/>

TUCKER: Come on, Malcolm, this is serious.
What if Phlox finds out? <br/>
REED: You haven't done anything to make her think that you <br/>
TUCKER: Of course not. Maybe I should tell the Doc.<br/>
REED: Tell him what? That his wife is trying to seduce you? Not a good
idea.<br/>
TUCKER: I've got to spend the next two days with her working on the
microscope. I really think I should speak to Phlox.<br/>
REED: It might be a lot easier to avoid her advances than to get Phlox
angry. I once saw him lose his temper when one of his creatures bit
him. It wasn't a pretty sight. </font></p>

cure, but it should slow down the progression of the disease. It's
surprising. I assumed your Science Directorate would've made more
progress than this.<br/>
T'POL: As we've seen, they're not very motivated to develop a cure.<br/>
PHLOX: With this research, I should be able to get closer than they
have.<br/>
ARCHER: (entering) How useful is it?<br/>
PHLOX: Very. It will allow me to improve my course of treatment long
before her symptoms get worse.<br/>
ARCHER: Have you figured out why Doctor Yuris gave it to you?<br/>
T'POL: No, I haven't. You spoke with them.<br/>
ARCHER: A few minutes ago. They've decided to recall you.<br/>
PHLOX: Do they have the authority to do that?<br/>
ARCHER: Doctor Oratt does. He's a ranking member of the Council of
Physicians. They plan on taking you back to Vulcan when the conference
is over.<br/>
T'POL: Have they notified the High Command?<br/>
ARCHER: Not till you reach Vulcan. You've got to tell them, T'Pol. Tell
them what happened. They won't do a thing to you once they know it
wasn't voluntary, that he did it against your will.<br/>
T'POL: I won't do that.<br/>
ARCHER: Why the hell not? <br/>
T'POL: I have Pa'nar Syndrome. It doesn't make a difference how I
contracted it.<br/>
ARCHER: It makes a lot of difference. You're not a member of this
minority. He forced himself on you. You said it yourself. <br/>
PHLOX: He's right, T'Pol. You should tell them.<br/>
T'POL: He is not right. If I use that as a defence as a way to keep
from being taken off Enterprise, I'd be condoning their prejudice, and
in the process, indicting every member of the minority. I won't do
that. </font></p>

and the trio.) <br/>
VULCAN: You're going to have to leave.<br/>
ARCHER: (pointing at Oratt) I need to talk to you!<br/>
VULCAN: I told him you were busy.<br/>
ORATT: What can I do for you, Captain? <br/>(Oratt glares at the Vulcan, who leaves
them.) <br/>
ARCHER: You have no right to take my Science Officer.<br/>
ORATT: You're mistaken. I have every right.<br/>
ARCHER: You can't dismiss someone just because you don't agree with the
way they conduct their personal lives. <br/>
ORATT: I am not dismissing T'Pol. I'm simply returning her to Vulcan.
The High Command will decide whether she is fit for duty.<br/>
ARCHER: Fit? You're saying a single mind-meld is enough to destroy her
career? Or is it that she contracted the disease? That's why you're so
hesitant to find a cure, isn't it? Why bother to help people you don't
approve of? <br/>
ORATT: I'm sorry you don't understand the complexities of our culture,
Captain. Please have the Sub-Commander ready to depart in thirty six
hours.<br/>
ARCHER: Not so fast. You know what this is, Doctor? My Communications
Officer got it from the Vulcan database. It's the protocols of the
Council of Physicians. It says that anyone accused of ethical
misconduct is entitled to a hearing before the ranking medical officer
in the province or territory where the accusation was first made. If
I'm not mistaken, that would be you.<br/>
ORATT: The accusation against T'Pol stands. It's not open for debate.<br/>
ARCHER: Where I come from, everything's open for debate. And if I read
these protocols correctly, so is the accusation you made against my
Science Officer.<br/>
ORATT: You're wasting your time.<br/>
ARCHER: It's mine to waste.<br/>
ORATT: Very well. But I will not delay our departure. The hearing will
take place tomorrow afternoon.<br/>

PHLOX: Just because they asked you to participate, doesn't mean you had
to.<br/>
TRAVIS: They said it was an honour. It looked easy enough.<br/>
PHLOX: You're lucky this creature didn't strike a bit lower. If I may
ask, what is the purpose of this sport?<br/>
TRAVIS: They've got these fargans. They're kind of like cows with
humps, and they love melons. I think they're melons. So, four guys get
into this big circle filled with fargans and they throw these melons
back and forth. They use sticks with metal baskets at the end. Do you
play monkey-in-the-middle on Denobula?<br/>
PHLOX: I don't believe so.<br/>
TRAVIS: Anyway, after a while, the fargans start figuring out what's
going on, and<br/>
TUCKER: (interrupting) You got a minute, Doc?<br/>
PHLOX: Are you not feeling well, Commander?<br/>
TUCKER: No, I'm fine. I just, er, I need to talk to you for a minute.<br/>
PHLOX: By all means. What's on your mind?<br/>
TUCKER: Actually, I was kind of hoping to talk to you alone.<br/>
PHLOX: I think we're about done here. It would be best if you avoided
fargans for a few days.<br/>
TRAVIS: Thanks, Doc. Commander. <br/>(Travis leaves.) <br/>
TUCKER: See you, Travis. Malcolm said this was a bad idea, but I, I
think it's the right thing to do.<br/>
PHLOX: What's that?<br/>
TUCKER: Feezal, I mean, Mrs. Phlox, is a lovely woman, and she's very
smart. She knows more about quantum optics than anyone I've ever met.<br/>
PHLOX: She is remarkable.<br/>
TUCKER: Remarkable, yeah, she sure is.<br/>
PHLOX: Was there something else?<br/>
TUCKER: Yeah, there is. You got to understand, I've been a perfect
gentleman. Absolutely nothing's happened. She's trying to. She's,
she's, er, making advances, if you know what I mean? <br/>
PHLOX: Sexual advances?<br/>
TUCKER: I'm afraid so.<br/>
PHLOX: (grinning) Has she offered to give you a rose petal bath?<br/>
TUCKER: No, no, no. Nothing like that.<br/>
PHLOX: Oh, any man would be a fool to ignore the romantic overtures of
a healthy Denobulan woman. Don't you find her attractive?<br/>
TUCKER: Sure. I mean, no, she's your wife.<br/>
PHLOX: What does that have to do with it?<br/>
TUCKER: She's your wife? <br/>
PHLOX: Oh, nonsense. Nonsense. You're too concerned with human
morality. I thought you wanted to learn about new cultures. Isn't that
why you joined Starfleet?<br/>
TUCKER: Why, of course it is. But I was brought up believing you don't
play around with another man's wife. I don't think I'm ever going to
change my mind about that.<br/>

you went to the surface.<br/>
ARCHER: I spoke to Doctor Oratt. I didn't tell you because I didn't
want you to try and talk me out of it.<br/>
T'POL: I assume you were unsuccessful.<br/>
ARCHER: Not exactly. Before I left, I got the medical protocols from
Hoshi. It seems they owe you a hearing.<br/>
T'POL: They'll never agree.<br/>
ARCHER: They already did.<br/>
T'POL: I have no interest in challenging their decision.<br/>
ARCHER: If you're not going to defend yourself, the least you can do is
speak for this minority you're so eager to protect. You said you didn't
want to condone the attitude of these doctors. Your silence would do
just that.<br/>
T'POL: You need to understand. I won't tell them how I got the disease.<br/>

understand, I'm not going to give you up without a fight. </font></p>

table, with Archer and T'Pol on chairs opposite.) <br/>
STROMM: The fact that she has Pa'nar Syndrome is not the reason she's
being recalled.<br/>
ARCHER: No. It has to do with how she got infected. A mind meld over a
year ago.<br/>
STROMM: When it took place is not pertinent.<br/>
ARCHER: So what you're saying is that if a Vulcan, even an officer in
the Science Directorate, engages in this exchange of thoughts and
memories, they're condemned for it?<br/>
ORATT: As you've been told, Captain, mind melds are practiced by a
subculture. Vulcans who have elected to conduct themselves in an
unacceptable manner.<br/>
T'POL: They haven't elected to do anything. They're born with this
ability.<br/>
STROMM: Exactly. They're genetic aberrations who prey on people like
you. People foolish enough to experiment with abhorrent behaviour.<br/>
ARCHER: You humans are too volatile, too irrational, too narrow-minded.
That's what I heard for years, from every Vulcan I met. But we don't
hold a candle to you when it comes to narrow-minded. We got rid of
bigotry nearly a century ago. We're not afraid of diversity. We don't
persecute it, we embrace it. If you call yourselves enlightened, you
have to accept people who are different than you are.<br/>
STROMM: This is pointless. Our culture is governed by rules. We're not
about to ignore them.<br/>
T'POL: There are no rules telling you to oppress minorities.<br/>
STROMM: You'd rather let them spread their infections. That's exactly
why you're being recalled.<br/>
T'POL: No, I'm being recalled because you're afraid of anything that
doesn't conform to your idea of acceptable behaviour.<br/>

decision's been made. We should end this inquiry. <br/>

ORATT: Are you questioning our judgement? <br/>
YURIS: There is nothing abhorrent about the way we lead our lives. <br/>
STROMM: We? <br/>
YURIS: There is no simple definition of intimacy. Those of us capable
of mind-melds are no different than you are. <br/>
ORATT: You realise that you are jeopardising your reputation, your
career? <br/>
YURIS: We share our thoughts differently. We shouldn't be punished for
that. <br/>
ORATT: The High Command will determine whether you should be punished.
Both of you. (stands to leave) <br/>
YURIS: She's not guilty of anything. She was violated. <br/>
T'POL: You gave me your word. <br/>
YURIS: The mind-meld was performed against her will. <br/>
ORATT: Can you verify this? <br/>
T'POL: Why? So you can perpetuate your double standard? Condemn the
infected when they meld by choice and sympathise with them when they
don't? <br/>
ORATT: What do you know of this, Captain? <br/>
ARCHER: Seems my Science Officer doesn't want to discuss it. That's
good enough for me. <br/>
