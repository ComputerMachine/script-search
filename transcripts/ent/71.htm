DEGRA: And you had no authorisation to launch an attack. <br/>
REPTILIAN: The humans should have been destroyed the moment they were
detected. <br/>
HUMANOID: The Council doesn't agree. <br/>
REPTILIAN: You're permitting an enemy vessel to remain in orbit near a
military installation! <br/>
DEGRA: Their ship is critically damaged. They no longer pose a threat. <br/>
REPTILIAN: Thanks to an attack that you opposed. At the very least, we
should board their vessel and take them prisoner. <br/>
ARBOREAL: It is being considered. <br/>
HUMANOID: On the subject of prisoners, the Council wants Archer for
further interrogation. <br/>
REPTILIAN: We're not finished with him. <br/>
DEGRA: You've questioned him long enough. <br/>
REPTILIAN: He hasn't provided us with the necessary information. <br/>
HUMANOID: Perhaps the Council will have more success. You're ordered to
release him immediately. <br/>
REPTILIAN: Very well. <br/>
DEGRA: We've arranged for his transport. <br/>
REPTILIAN: We can deliver him. <br/>
DEGRA: He's already been severely beaten under your care. <br/>
REPTILIAN: He is the commander of an enemy vessel. <br/>
HUMANOID: We need Archer in good condition. <br/>
DEGRA: If he can't answer questions, we can't interrogate him. <br/>
REPTILIAN: He will not be harmed any further. You have my assurances. <br/>
DEGRA: That isn't good enough. <br/>
REPTILIAN: Meaning? <br/>
DEGRA: It wouldn't be the first of your assurances that fell short. <br/>
ARBOREAL: The Council has agreed that the aquatics will transport the
prisoner. They've sent a ship. Get him ready. </font></p>

a complete casualty list yet. So far the news isn't good. Five people
are confirmed dead, a dozen wounded. Most of the hull breaches have
been contained with emergency bulkheads. <br/>
T'POL: What about Cargo Bay two? <br/>
REED: I don't know. There's no way to get to it. A large portion of E
deck is still decompressed. <br/>
T'POL: Weapons? <br/>
REED: The aft torpedo launcher's working, but that's about it. I really
don't know what's holding us together, but let's hope it doesn't give
out. </font></p>

TUCKER: The primary warp coil's fried. It has to be rebuilt from
scratch. <br/>
T'POL: How long? <br/>
TUCKER: A couple of weeks, if we had the parts. We don't. As it stands
now, warp drive's out of the question. <br/>
T'POL: Impulse? <br/>
TUCKER: I'll have to inspect the hull around the exhaust manifolds, see
the damage first-hand. <br/>
T'POL: Make it a priority. <br/>
TUCKER: We've had a lot of injuries down here. It could speed things up
if you assign me some extra help. <br/>(Another bang makes a nervous T'Pol
jump out of her skin.) <br/>TUCKER: Engineering isn't the safest place to be right

REED: I'll have to pull people from other areas. <br/>
T'POL: There are engineering components in Cargo Bay two. They're
crucial to Commander Tucker's repairs. <br/>
REED: Aye. <br/>

PHLOX: Fourteen. Three are unaccounted for. <br/>
ARCHER: Don't waste time on me. <br/>
PHLOX: It's good to see you again, Captain. (goes to tend to others on
biobeds) <br/>
T'POL: Damage report. (hands over a PADD) We'll have impulse power in
six hours. <br/>
(Archer stares at three bodies on the floor, covered by
blankets.) <br/>
T'POL: Aft torpedo launchers and one forward phase cannon are
online. <br/>
ARCHER: Have Hoshi and Travis start analysing that pod. <br/>
T'POL: Its configuration suggests it's aquatic. <br/>
ARCHER: I was aboard one of their ships. That's the last thing I
remember. <br/>
T'POL: Do you have any idea why they released you? <br/>
ARCHER: I think I may have gotten through to one of them. Degra. <br/>(T'Pol
hands him a towel. Her hand is shaking so he holds it.) <br/>ARCHER: Thanks. Are you
all right? <br/>
T'POL: I'm fine. I should help Lieutenant Reed with his repairs. <br/>
(Her journey through the corridors however, has a sound and vision
distorted, horror film quality to it. She gets to her quarters and
bathes her face.) </font></p>

Do you really think they'll attack us again? <br/>
ARCHER: They're not exactly unified. The reptilians came after us on
their own. They might decide to finish what they started. <br/>
REED: We've run out of moons to hide behind, but there is a cometary
dust cloud not too far off. <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pol? <br/>
T'POL: The diamagnetic field should shield us from long range scans. <br/>
ARCHER: How far away is it? <br/>
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering to the Bridge. We just picked up a surge in
the EPS grid on A deck. <br/>(Bang! Everyone ducks and rubble lands on the
central display console.)<br/>
ARCHER: Thanks for the warning. How far? <br/>
REED: At present speed, about three days. <br/>
ARCHER: Set a course. <br/>
TRAVIS: Aye sir. <br/>
TUCKER: Instead of hiding, shouldn't we be looking for the weapon? <br/>
T'POL: Our sensors are still offline. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's focus on getting ourselves operational. We can't mount a
search with a ship coming down on our heads. </font></p>

getting home. </font></p>

guy? <br/>
ARCHER: Who? <br/>
TUCKER: Degra. He seems like the last person who'd come around to our
side. I mean, he designed the weapon. <br/>
ARCHER: He may not be on our side, but I get the feeling he's starting
to question his. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, let's hope you're right. I think we're ready to fire this
up. (Bang!) Maybe not. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer. <br/>
ARCHER: Go ahead. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: There's an unidentified vessel approaching. They're asking
for our assistance. <br/>
ARCHER: Any details? <br/>
T'POL [OC]: Just that they've taken heavy damage. <br/>
TUCKER: Join the club. <br/>
ARCHER: How long till they get here? <br/>

T'POL: I'm detecting numerous spatial anomalies in the area. <br/>
ARCHER: Can you get us through them? <br/>
T'POL: I believe so. <br/>
ARCHER: Hail them. This is Captain Archer. We're responding to your
distress call. <br/>
ILLYRIAN [OC]: Thank you for coming, but be aware. This region contains
dangerous spatial distortions. <br/>
ARCHER: We've run into them before. <br/>
ILLYRIAN [OC]: They've damaged our engines and life support. We would
appreciate whatever assistance you can give us. <br/>
ARCHER: We'll see what we can do. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Illyrian ship is almost as big as Enterprise,
and docked alongside.) <br/>
ARCHER: What brings you to this system? <br/>
ILLYRIAN: (humanoid) Curiosity. We're studying the red giant. It's the
first one we've had the opportunity to explore. We weren't prepared for
these spatial anomalies as you call them. Seems you weren't either. <br/>
ARCHER: Actually, this is all the result of combat. <br/>
ILLYRIAN: Combat? <br/>
ARCHER: Have you heard of a species called the Xindi? <br/>
ILLYRIAN: No. We're new to this region of space. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's talk about your ship. We know a way to insulate against
the anomalies. There's a substance called trellium-D. <br/>
ILLYRIAN: I've heard of it. It's extremely rare. <br/>
ARCHER: I have sixty kilos sitting in my cargo bay. <br/>
ILLYRIAN: Perhaps we can work out some sort of trade. <br/>
ARCHER: That's what I had in mind. <br/>
ILLYRIAN: Given the condition of my vessel, I don't know what we can
offer you. <br/>
ARCHER: Our warp engine is badly damaged. <br/>
ILLYRIAN: We could probably spare a few plasma injectors, maybe some
antimatter. <br/>
ARCHER: I was thinking more along the lines of a warp coil. <br/>
ILLYRIAN: I'm afraid that's one thing we can't spare. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe we can make it worth your while. We have certain
technology that you'd probably find useful. <br/>
ILLYRIAN: Without a warp coil, the journey back to our system would
take three years. We're not equipped for a voyage of that length. <br/>
ARCHER: The Xindi have already wiped out seven million of my people.
Now they're building a weapon to destroy our entire world. I have to
stop them. Without warp drive, I won't succeed. <br/>
ILLYRIAN: I sympathise, Captain. I will help you in any other way, but
I won't jeopardize the lives of my crew. I'm sorry. <br/>

passionately in the shower, when she turns into a Zombie Vulcan from
'Impulse' and attacks him. She wakes up distressed, gets an environment
suit and heads off through the vacuum of E deck to a very wrecked Cargo
Bay two. She falls trying to get to the lower level and her air supply
disconnects. Panicking, she manages to reconnect it and then goes to
the trellium-D storage box. She removes some rocks from a canister near
the bottom. In the lab, she turns the rock into liquid and injects
herself with it.) </font></p>

Aside from that, nothing out of the ordinary. <br/>
HOSHI: I've gone through the databanks. Just your standard navigational
operational files, but I did find one document. An engineer asking his
supervisors for additional parts. Here's a translation. <br/>
ARCHER: The names of these supervisors. Piral, Jaina, Trenia. <br/>
HOSHI: The names of Degra's children. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: I discovered a set of coordinates embedded
in the document. <br/>
ARCHER: It's not a star system. <br/>
T'POL: There was another embedded number. A stardate, three days from
now. <br/>
ARCHER: How far away are the coordinates? <br/>
T'POL: Four light years. We'll need at least warp three to make it in
time. It's unlikely that Degra will wait beyond three days. </font></p>

was the perfect house guest, as usual. You'll be happy to know that I
discharged Ensign Ansara this morning, and Corporal O'Malley will be
returning to duty this afternoon. Captain? <br/>
ARCHER: It's hard to imagine that we'll ever get this ship back to the
way it was. <br/>
PHLOX: It's a simple matter of repairs. Well, perhaps not that simple.
Somehow, I don't think it's the damage to Enterprise that's troubling
you. <br/>
ARCHER: How long have you been a doctor? <br/>
PHLOX: Nearly forty years. <br/>
ARCHER: And in all that time, did you ever do anything you thought was
unethical? <br/>
PHLOX: Twice. Why? <br/>
ARCHER: I'm about to step over a line, a line I thought I would never
cross. And given the nature of our mission, it probably won't be the
last. <br/>
PHLOX: Probably not. May I ask what you're planning to do? <br/>

us. <br/>
BUILDER: There's distrust amongst you. <br/>
ARBOREAL: You can help alleviate it. <br/>
BUILDER: Continue. <br/>
DEGRA: We were told the reptilians attempted to build a bioweapon. <br/>
BUILDER: Who told you this? <br/>
HUMANOID: We've also learned that they were building this bioweapon in
the past, on Earth. <br/>
DEGRA: As far as we're aware, reptilians don't possess the technology
for time travel. <br/>
BUILDER: You want to know if they had my help. <br/>
DEGRA: Did they? <br/>
BUILDER: Yes. After you prohibited them from constructing the
bioweapon, the reptilians and the insectoids were prepared to withdraw
from the Council. I assisted them so the Council would remain unified. <br/>
DEGRA: You helped them to circumvent our authority. <br/>
BUILDER: I protected your authority by keeping the Council intact. <br/>
DEGRA: What happened to the bioweapon? <br/>
BUILDER: It was never completed, and the three reptilians were never
found. <br/>
ARBOREAL: You can't locate them. <br/>
BUILDER: There are limits to what we can do in your realm. <br/>
DEGRA: It seems you can do more than we thought. Is it true your
species built the Spheres? <br/>
BUILDER: What makes you think you can subject me to this interrogation?
If it weren't for my assistance, your species would be facing
destruction. <br/>
ARBOREAL: We're grateful for the help that you've given us. <br/>
BUILDER: Then prove it. Focus on the task at hand. The weapon is nearly
complete. If you permit yourselves to become distracted, you'll fail to
destroy your real enemy. The enemy of all Xindi. Don't summon me again
unless every member of the Council is present. I won't help fuel your
internal bickering. <br/>(She vanishes.) <br/>
HUMANOID: You don't believe her. <br/>

ARCHER: Let's make sure they don't get any lucky shots. <br/>
TRAVIS: Why don't we just transport their warp coil to Enterprise? <br/>
TUCKER: It's tied into their injector system. If we use the
transporter, we'd destroy their engines. I've got to get in there,
decouple it by hand. <br/>
REED: How long? <br/>
TUCKER: Ten minutes, give or take. Can't tell for sure until I see it. <br/>

ARCHER: We can't risk tipping them off. We have to take them by
surprise. That'll reduce the losses on both sides. We'll disable their
ship as quickly as we can, beam over, extract the warp coil and get
out, hopefully without any casualties. Set a course. <br/>

T'POL: By stealing their warp coil we could be condemning them to
death. <br/>
ARCHER: We're going to leave them a supply of trellium, along with some
extra food. I'm not saying it'll be easy for them, but they'll stand a
decent chance of making it home. <br/>
T'POL: You're forgetting that we're in a dangerous region of space. Our
assault could cripple their ability to defend themselves. <br/>

human. Those were your words to me. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm no happier doing this than you are, but we're not going to
make a habit of it. <br/>
T'POL: Once you rationalise the first mis-step, it's easy to fall into
a pattern of behaviour. <br/>

doing. <br/>

off I discovered I was able to access certain emotions. I wanted more.
I began to experiment by ingesting small amounts of trellium. I devised
a way to inject it into my bloodstream. <br/>
PHLOX: You must have known it was dangerous. Trellium exposure is
deadly to Vulcans. It eats away at the neural pathways. <br/>
T'POL: I thought, in small amounts, it would be safe. At first, I was
able to control the new emotions. My interactions with the crew
improved. <br/>
PHLOX: Commander Tucker, for example. When did you realise you were
becoming addicted? <br/>
T'POL: Two days ago. The damage to E deck made it impossible to access
the cargo bay. I began experiencing agitation, anxiety, withdrawal
symptoms. <br/>
PHLOX: You're not experiencing them now. <br/>
T'POL: I was able to retrieve the trellium. I was almost killed in the
process. <br/>
PHLOX: This will help stabilise your synaptic pathways, but the
withdrawal symptoms will return in a few days. It's going to take time.
It won't be easy. <br/>
T'POL: I understand. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to T'Pol. <br/>
T'POL: Go ahead. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: We're approaching the vessel. Report to the Bridge. <br/>
T'POL: I'm on my way. <br/>
PHLOX: You should remain here for observation. <br/>
T'POL: The Captain needs me. I have to go. <br/>
PHLOX: I expect you to report back here at the first sign of trouble. <br/>
T'POL: Are you going to discuss this with the Captain? <br/>
PHLOX: This is between you and your doctor. </font></p>

ILLYRIAN: What you can't have, you take by force? <br/>

as compensation. There's also food and supplies. <br/>
ILLYRIAN: You're stranding us three years from home. Why are you doing
this? <br/>

T'POL: Perhaps. <br/>
PHLOX: How do you feel? <br/>
T'POL: I thought that without the trellium I would no longer have
difficulty suppressing my emotions, but that's not true. <br/>
PHLOX: It's not surprising that there are residual effects. They're
probably temporary. <br/>
T'POL: And if they're not? <br/>
