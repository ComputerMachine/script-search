T'POL: When. <br/>
ARCHER: I didn't know you drank wine. <br/>
T'POL: Under the circumstances I'll allow myself a small indulgence. <br/>
TUCKER: Make mine a large indulgence. <br/>
ARCHER: To our Science Officer. It's been one year to the day since you
officially joined our crew. <br/>
TUCKER: Here's to many more. <br/>
T'POL: I appreciate the sentiment but I'm simply carrying out my
assignment. <br/>
ARCHER: That's no small accomplishment considering the previous record
for a Vulcan serving on a human ship was two weeks. <br/>
T'POL: Ten days. <br/>
ARCHER: I've been filling out your annual crew evaluation. Just a
formality. <br/>
T'POL: I understand. The High Command has requested my evaluation of
you. Just a formality. <br/>
ARCHER: There's something in your record I've been meaning to ask you
about. While you were stationed in Sausalito you took a five-day leave.
<br/>
T'POL: Yes? <br/>
ARCHER: You went to an old mining town in Pennsylvania, Carbon Creek?
Seems like an odd place to take a vacation. <br/>
T'POL: Vulcans don't take vacations. <br/>
ARCHER: Then, if I may ask, why'd you go there? <br/>
T'POL: Is this part of my evaluation? <br/>
ARCHER: Just curious. <br/>
T'POL: It was a personal matter. <br/>
TUCKER: You had a personal matter in Carbon Creek, Pennsylvania? <br/>
ARCHER: Trip, if she doesn't want to tell us. <br/>
TUCKER: Seems a little unfair. We tell her plenty of stories. <br/>
T'POL: You'd like me to tell you a story? <br/>
TUCKER: If it's a good one. <br/>
T'POL: I went to Carbon Creek because I wanted to visit the site of
First Contact between humans and Vulcans. <br/>
ARCHER: Then you were about three thousand kilometres off. That took
place in Montana. <br/>
T'POL: Actually, it didn't. <br/>
TUCKER: Every school kid knows that Zephram Cochrane met the Vulcans in
Bozeman, Montana, on April 5th, 2063. I've been there. There's a
statue. <br/>
T'POL: In fact, the Vulcans visited Earth long before then. My second
foremother was one of them. <br/>
TUCKER: Your who? <br/>
T'POL: My mother's mother's mother. Would you like to hear the story? </font></p>

T'POL: The incident is well-documented at the Science Directorate and
the Space Council. <br/>
TUCKER: On Vulcan? <br/>
T'POL: Of course. <br/>
TUCKER: Hang on. T'Mir was your great-grandmother? I'd be the last
person to question your math, but aren't you missing a few generations?
Sputnik was two hundred years ago. <br/>
ARCHER: Don't forget how long Vulcans live. <br/>
TUCKER: Right. Just how old are you? <br/>(He gets a glare and turns to Archer.)
<br/>TUCKER: It's got to be in her record. <br/>
ARCHER: Trip, that's classified information. Please, go on. <br/>
T'POL: Their subspace transceiver was damaged in the crash. They had no
way of knowing if their distress signal had even been transmitted. </font></p>

within a week. After five days without food their situation was growing
desperate. <br/>
T'MIR: (scanner is beeping) Two lifeforms. <br/>(A couple of deer.)
<br/>T'MIR: Fascinating. <br/>
MESTRAL: One of those creatures could sustain us for some time. <br/>
STRON: Are you suggesting we eat it? <br/>
MESTRAL: It's logical to take extreme measures to survive. <br/>
STRON: Even resorting to savagery? <br/>
MESTRAL: That may not be necessary. Our scans showed a settlement
approximately six kilometres away. <br/>
T'MIR: If we're exposed, we could contaminate their culture. <br/>
MESTRAL: And when they find our bodies after we starve, will that
contaminate their culture? <br/>
STRON: Better to leave them with a mystery than with three living
aliens. <br/>
MESTRAL: We should at least investigate the possibilities. <br/>
T'MIR: It's too dangerous. <br/>
MESTRAL: I'm willing to take the risk. <br/>(Mestral walks off) <br/>
T'MIR: Mestral. (to Stron) Remain here. </font></p>

suggest we proceed? <br/>
MESTRAL: We'll need to disguise ourselves. <br/>
(So they steal clothes off a line. T'Mir changes behind a sheet.) <br/>
T'MIR: We're here to find food, nothing else. We'll keep contact with
the humans to an absolute minimum. If we must interact with them I will
speak. <br/>(She comes out from behind the sheet trying to do up a dress.) <br/>T'MIR: What
is it? <br/>
MESTRAL: I believe you have that garment on backwards. <br/>
(They walk along the main street. Mistral has a woolly hat pulled down
over his ears and T'Mir has found a pair of shoes from somewhere too.
They see a group of men getting off a bus.) <br/>
T'MIR: Prisoners? <br/>
MESTRAL: They don't appear to be restrained. More likely labourers. <br/>
T'MIR: It's hard to believe these people were capable of launching an
artificial satellite. <br/>
(They hear a voice from a car radio and go to investigate the group of
men listening to the match.) <br/>
RADIO: And he gets the sigh, and here's the pitch. Dixon hits a
scorcher down the right field line. The first baseman takes a stab at
it, but no! Ellis is charging hard from right field. He scoops it up
and fires. It's going to be close. There's a collision at the plate,
but Wilcox hangs on to the ball and Thompson is out! <br/>
T'MIR: (walking on) Some type of combat, no doubt. <br/>
MESTRAL: I believe it may be an entertainment. <br/>
(The Pine Tree bar and grill.) <br/>
T'MIR: A communal gathering place. <br/>

away.) <br/>

Quarter a ball? <br/>
JACK: (a student carrying books) I'll play. <br/>
BILLY: You better ask your mother, Jackie. <br/>
JACK: Come on, Mom, we could use the money. <br/>
MAGGIE: Go on upstairs and do your homework. I'll bring you up some
dinner. <br/>
MESTRAL: I'm up for a game. <br/>
T'MIR: What are you doing? I told you not to speak to anyone. <br/>
MESTRAL: I can defeat him. <br/>
T'MIR: You don't even know the rules. <br/>
MESTRAL: It's simple. <br/>

T'MIR: He doesn't. <br/>
BILLY: Well, sorry, pal. There's nothing in it for me. <br/>
T'MIR: It's time for us to go. <br/>
BILLY: Wait a minute. We might be able to work something out. If you
win, I'll pay up. If I win, your business associate has a drink with
me. <br/>
MESTRAL: We accept your terms. <br/>
T'MIR: We do not. <br/>
MESTRAL: The game is based on simple geometry. It wouldn't challenge a
Vulcan child. <br/>
T'MIR: No. <br/>
MESTRAL: We need their currency. <br/>
T'MIR: What if you lose? I'll have to socialise with him. <br/>
MESTRAL: Would you rather die of starvation? <br/>

T'POL: What are you implying? <br/>
TUCKER: Two Vulcans stroll into a bar, hustle a few games of pool and
walk out with an armload of TV dinners. It sounds like an old episode
of The Twilight Zone. <br/>
T'POL: If you're not interested in hearing the rest <br/>(She starts to leave
the table.) <br/>
ARCHER: Hold on, hold on. We didn't say we weren't interested. <br/>
T'POL: They realised they couldn't rely on gambling </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (T'Mir is sweeping the floor.) <br/>
T'POL [OC]: So they took whatever employment they could find while they
waited for the rescue vessel to arrive. <br/>
(Stron is doing plumbing, and cheating by using his weapon to solder a
leaky U-bend, while Mestral has joined the miners underground.) <br/>
T'POL [OC]: But as the weeks passed, it seemed less likely that their
distress call had been received, and it became more difficult for them
to avoid the humans. <br/>
(Later,  a broadcast of the White Sands test is on the TV screen behind the
bar.) <br/>
TV: The test of a nuclear device is designed for tactical use in place
of artillery. Zero hour was just after five. <br/>

MESTRAL: I'd hate to see humanity destroy itself. <br/>

JACK: Want to shoot some eight ball? <br/>
MAGGIE: Jack. <br/>
JACK: I've got a geometry midterm next week. It's good practice. <br/>
MAGGIE: Nice try, but there's better ways to prepare for a math test. <br/>
MESTRAL: Are you interested in mathematics? <br/>
JACK: It's what I want to study at college. Mechanical engineering, if
I get to go. <br/>
MAGGIE: You will. He got a scholarship. <br/>
JACK: Only a partial one. <br/>
MAGGIE: It's still a scholarship and you worked hard for it.
Everybody's been pitching in to help pay for his expenses. Books, room
and board. <br/>(She puts a tip in the glass jar.) <br/>MAGGIE: You can shoot one rack and

STRON: This is the third time
this week I've had to fix Mrs. Garrett's sink. <br/>
MESTRAL: Perhaps she enjoys your company. <br/>
STRON: It might be tolerable if her son didn't insist on calling me
Moe. <br/>
T'MIR: Why does he do that? <br/>
STRON: There is a comic actor known as a Stooge with that name. The boy
believes we have similar hair. <br/>
MESTRAL: There is a resemblance. <br/>
STRON: This is intolerable. I'm a warp field engineer. <br/>
T'MIR: Then perhaps you can help me construct a subspace transceiver. <br/>
STRON: I told you, it's impossible. <br/>
T'MIR: If we remain here, we'll die. This world's on the brink of
self-annihilation. <br/>
MESTRAL: I don't believe that. <br/>
T'MIR: Because your fascination with this species is blinding you. You
sit for hours each day in front of this idiotic device. <br/>
MESTRAL: I'm doing research. Perhaps if you spent more time observing
human behaviour you might not have such a pessimistic view of them. <br/>
T'MIR: Open your eyes. They revel in violence. They devote what little
technology they have to devising ways of killing each other. <br/>
MESTRAL: So did we centuries ago. They just haven't realised their
potential yet. <br/>
T'MIR: What potential? <br/>
MESTRAL: They have great empathy and compassion. Look how we've been
made to feel welcome. <br/>
T'MIR: Only because they believe we're human. If they discovered the
truth do you think they'd be so compassionate? Where are you going? <br/>
MESTRAL: To the ship. <br/>
T'MIR: Why? <br/>
MESTRAL: This antenna is inadequate. I believe I can use a waveform
discriminator to enhance it. <br/>
T'MIR: It'll be safer to go after dark. You can't risk being followed. <br/>

could do something else. Take in a movie? <br/>

MAGGIE: You mean my husband? <br/>
MESTRAL: Yes. <br/>
MAGGIE: He left a long time ago. Jack used to get letters from him
every now and then. The last we heard, he'd moved to Phoenix. I was
hoping he would help with Jack's college but I guess we're on our own.
I can understand why he wouldn't want to have anything to do with me
but. I'm sorry, I'm usually better at keeping a lid on my emotions.
It's not always easy. <br/>
MESTRAL: I know. <br/>
MAGGIE: Well, I'm due back at the Pine Tree. Will I see you later? <br/>(He
nods. There's a pause then she kisses him.) <br/>MESTRAL Oh, I didn't mean to. I
thought, I thought. Oh, God. <br/>
MESTRAL: Please, I was simply surprised. It was very pleasant. <br/>
MAGGIE: Pleasant? <br/>
MESTRAL: Wasn't that an appropriate response? <br/>

spiritual plane? I spend a lot of time at the library. <br/>
T'MIR: Studying meditation techniques? <br/>
JACK: Different things. Mostly about places I'd like to visit, like
Tibet. The Buddhist monks there meditate every day. And in India,
they're got these mystics called fakirs. Supposedly they can almost
stop their hearts just by using willpower. <br/>
T'MIR: You'd be surprised what a disciplined mind can accomplish. What
else do you study at this library? <br/>

at the junction. <br/>
MESTRAL [OC]: Understood. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Mine]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'MIR [OC]: In eight metres, you'll find a narrow
opening near the ground that leads to an abandoned shaft. <br/>
MINER: (rushing past Mestral) I think we're getting more guys down
there. <br/>
MINER 2: Is the ride free up there? <br/>
MINER: Yeah. <br/>
(Mestral finds a small, well supported shaft and crawls along it on
hands and knees.) <br/>
T'MIR [OC]: There's a stratum of quartz on the wall, opposite the
opening. <br/>
MESTRAL: I see it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Above ground]</b> </font></p>

made.) <br/></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MESTRAL: How far? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Above ground]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'MIR: Approximately thirty metres. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Mestral makes his way to the trapped men.) <br/>
MINER 3: Here, over here. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: After rescuing the twelve miners, Mestral became something
of a hero that day. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Captain's mess]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: Didn't people wonder how he got them out? <br/>
T'POL: I'm sure they did, but no one ever discovered the truth. Three
months passed </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Vulcan's apartment]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL [OC]: And just as they had resigned
themselves to the fact that, in all likelihood, they would never leave
Earth. <br/>
(T'Mir is reading, Mestral watching TV, and Stron trying to construct a
subspace transceiver out of bearskins and, well, you know, when the
communicator in the cupboard starts beeping.) <br/>
T'MIR: T'Mir. <br/>
TELLUS [OC]: This is Captain Tellus of Vulcan Survey vessel D'Vahl. I'm
responding to your distress signal. <br/>
T'MIR: We thought it wasn't transmitted. <br/>
TELLUS [OC]: Your signal was picked up by a Tellarite freighter. It
took them some time to forward it to the High Command. We're
approaching the system now. Meet us at the crash site in three days. <br/>
T'MIR: Understood. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Jack pulls up in Maggie's car while T'Mir is
sweeping leaves.) <br/>
JACK: I hear you're leaving. <br/>
T'MIR: That's correct. <br/>
JACK: Where to? <br/>
T'MIR: Home. Up north. <br/>
JACK: I'm going to miss you. You're about the most interesting people
I've met in this town. <br/>
T'MIR: I'm sure you'll meet a lot of interesting people at college. <br/>
JACK: I'm not going. <br/>
T'MIR: What? Why not? <br/>
JACK: We couldn't come up with the rest of the money. The deadline for
the tuition's Friday, so <br/>
T'MIR: What will you do? <br/>JACK: Keep saving, I guess. Find a job. Mom
doesn't want me anywhere near the mine but that's where the work is
around here. <br/>
T'MIR: Can you try again next year for the scholarship? <br/>
JACK: I'll reapply, but there's no guarantee. <br/>
T'MIR: I'm sure they will offer it to you again. <br/>
JACK: And if not, there's always the library. Still a lot of books I
haven't read. Good luck up north. Carbon Creek's not exactly a vacation
spot, but I hope you'll come visit us. <br/>
T'MIR: Perhaps. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Maggie has been listening at the door.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
MAGGIE: He took those college
boards, got the highest score of anybody in the county. it's not fair.<br/>(On the Vulcan ship, T'Mir searchs for something, and eventually
finds it, then she takes a train journey to Pittsburgh.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BUSINESSMAN: So, you're the lady with the
invention that's going to change the world. <br/>

beams. She leaves with a sheaf of bank notes.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Pine Tree bar]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MAGGIE: Morning. <br/>(Then she sees all the bank notes

floor and Stron is working on something.) <br/>
T'MIR: Didn't you terminate your employment? <br/>
STRON: Yes, but I promised Mrs. Garrett I'd repair this suction device.
<br/>
MESTRAL: It's unfortunate that you'll be leaving these people without
experiencing one thing they have to offer. <br/>
STRON: Such as alcohol, frozen fish sticks, the constant threat of
nuclear annihilation? <br/>
MESTRAL: There's much more to them. You just refuse to see it. <br/>
STRON: I've seen enough. <br/>
MESTRAL: I haven't. I plan to stay here. <br/>
STRON: If this is your attempt at humour <br/>
MESTRAL: They're on the verge of countless social and technological
advancements. I have the unique opportunity to study an emerging
species. <br/>
STRON: That's what you've done, much closer than we anticipated. Your
duty is to return to Vulcan and report your findings. <br/>
MESTRAL: There's still more to learn about these people. <br/>
T'MIR: All of them or just one? <br/>
MESTRAL: This has nothing to do with Maggie. She has helped me
appreciate their culture, but I don't intend to remain in Carbon Creek.
<br/>
T'MIR: Where would you go? <br/>
MESTRAL: To one of their larger cities at first. After that, I'm not
certain. There's so much to see. <br/>
STRON: The High Command will never allow it. Tell him it's not
possible. T'Mir? <br/>
T'MIR: Perhaps I can arrange for you to be on the next survey ship. <br/>
MESTRAL: In another twenty years, running more statistical scans from
high orbit? That's not enough. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TELLUS: Where is your captain? <br/>
T'MIR: He was killed in the crash. <br/>
TELLUS: There were four Vulcans aboard your vessel. <br/>
T'MIR: Mestral died in the crash as well. We cremated their remains. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TUCKER: Do you realise you've just rewritten our
history books? <br/>
T'POL: A footnote, at best. <br/>
TUCKER: Footnote? This is like finding out Neil Armstrong wasn't the
first man to walk on the moon. <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps he wasn't. <br/>
ARCHER: How long did this Mestral stay on Earth? <br/>
T'POL: The rest of his life, presumably. <br/>
ARCHER: And that would be what, another hundred, hundred and fifty
years? <br/>
T'POL: Possibly longer. <br/>
TUCKER: An alien is left on Earth in the 1950s, lives through, what,
thirty Presidents? Travels the world, and no one notices him? And what
happened when he finally kicked the bucket? Did the undertaker just
shrug and ignore his ears? <br/>
T'POL: You asked me to tell you a story. <br/>
TUCKER: And it was a good one. But did it really happen? <br/>
T'POL: As I said, you asked me to tell you a story. <br/>
TUCKER: Damn, Captain, she put one over on us. <br/>
ARCHER: You did go to Carbon Creek. <br/>
T'POL: If you check my record, you'll note that I also visited
Yellowstone Park and the Carlsbad Caverns. I'm a scientist. That
includes geology. Thank you for the meal. <br/>
ARCHER: My pleasure. You've certainly kept us entertained. <br/>
T'POL: Good night.<br/>(In her quarters, preparing for her meditation
before sleep, T'Pol takes something out of a cupboard. It is the
handbag T'Mir was carrying when she took the Velcro pouch to
Pittsburgh.) </font> </p>
