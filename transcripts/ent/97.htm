SOVAL: Spontaneous demonstrations have already begun around the Vulcan

SAMUELS: Isolated incidents, I'm sure. <br/>
ANDORIAN: There are protesters chanting outside the Andorian embassy.
And they're using words that aren't in the universal translator. <br/>
SOVAL: It's obvious Paxton's ultimatum is part of a co-ordinated plan. <br/>
ANDORIAN: Why are we all still here? We could be obliterated at any
second! <br/>
SAMUELS: Paxton's a fanatic, but he's a man of his word. He won't act
before his deadline's up. <br/>
SOVAL: The deadline aside, the fact that Paxton has the support of so
many of your people is almost as troubling. <br/>
ANDORIAN: I agree. Earthmen talk about uniting worlds, but your own
planet is deeply divided. Perhaps you're not quite ready to host this

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARCHER: Paxton's holding two of my officers hostage
at the array. We can't attack it. <br/>
SAMUELS: The Council's aware of that. If you can't bring yourself to
fire on them, another Captain can be assigned to Enterprise. No one
will think less of you. <br/>
ARCHER: It's not just the hostages. Any attack on the array will
trigger a massive explosion that could kill thousands of colonists. <br/>
SAMUELS: This wasn't an easy decision for the Council. The potential
for disaster's even greater than you think. Over the next thirty
months, the terraforming project has fourteen comets set to collide
with Mars. Without the array to divert them toward the polar caps, the
comets could hit anywhere, even the domed cities. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll take in a small team. We'll break into the facility and
stop them. <br/>

TUCKER: They'd need cells from both of us. <br/>
PAXTON: The medical freezers on your ship hold bio-samples from your
entire crew. Terra Prime has supporters everywhere. <br/>

PAXTON: I've let you see your daughter. That's my half of the bargain.

might start to talk. <br/>
REED: I don't like it any more than you do. <br/>
HARRIS: So, you want to go to Mars and you need my help. <br/>
REED: You know the situation. <br/>
HARRIS: I believe I'm aware of the broad strokes. I also understand
Paxton's tapped into the planetary sensor grid. No one can get within a
thousand kilometres of the verteron array without being detected. <br/>
REED: And you're going to tell me how. <br/>
HARRIS: What makes you think I even have that information? <br/>
REED: Because your section routinely thinks about the unthinkable. And
because you'd never miss a chance to put me in your debt. <br/>
HARRIS: You're a good judge of character. The grid was designed to
function in the planet's original atmosphere, but terraforming's made
the air much thicker. <br/>
REED: How does that help us? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>
(Harris hands over a computer file which Reed puts into a PADD.) </font><br/>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HARRIS:
Sections of the grid continually need re-calibration and are prone to
false signals. You can exploit that weakness. The good news is, with
terraforming there's no more need for pressure suits in the lowland.
Oxygen, yes. Thermal garments <br/>
REED: According to this, if we keep our altitude less than ten metres
above the surface, Paxton won't see us. <br/>
HARRIS: You'll still need to reach the surface undetected. <br/>
REED: That part's taken care of, without your help. <br/>
HARRIS: So, the student has surpassed the teacher. When you're finished
with Mars, why don't you come work for me? <br/>
REED: I've got quite enough to keep me busy on Enterprise. <br/>
HARRIS: And if Archer's coalition is formed, Enterprise could be busier
than ever. <br/>

human. <br/>
T'POL: Human and Vulcan genes produced this child, which indicates our
two species have more similarities than differences. <br/>
PAXTON: Don't you realise that baby is, (his hand shakes) That baby is
as much a threat to your species as it is to mine? <br/>
T'POL: She's not a threat. <br/>
PAXTON: That child is a cross-breed freak. How many generations before
our genome is so diluted that the word human is nothing more than a
footnote in some medical text? The same thing could happen to your
people, or don't you care about that? <br/>
T'POL: Neither of our species is what it was a million years ago, nor
what it'll become in the future. Life is change. <br/>
PAXTON: Change in this case means extinction, and I, for one, will not
let that baby bring humanity to that point. <br/>

T'POL: Colonel Green also said, to be human is to be pure. Under his
rule, you would have been euthanised for having a genetic disorder. <br/>
PAXTON: I'm not the first significant leader who failed to measure up
to his own ideal. <br/>
T'POL: You're not significant! <br/>
PAXTON: History will determine that! So go ahead, tell my followers
what you wish. See if they take the word of an alien over mine. What's
wrong with your child? <br/>
T'POL: Elevated white-blood cell count, low-grade fever. <br/>
PAXTON: Well, its two halves are warring with one another. Alien and
human. Conflict was inevitable.<br/>
(He opens the door.) <br/>
PAXTON: Josiah. <br/>
(Josiah comes in to take T'Pol away.) <br/>

your father. He wanted the secrets of warp technology so badly, he
allowed the Vulcans to turn him into their pet human. And you, well,
the sins of the father. <br/>
(The window continues to splinter.) <br/>

PAXTON: My father never asked anything from anyone. His mining
operations transformed the moon from a mere colony into a completely
self-sufficient world, and that is how we should go to the stars.
Taking the worlds we need and taming them, with human hands, and human
minds, and human souls. <br/>
ARCHER: That might've worked for the moon, but the galaxy's a lot more
crowded than we thought. <br/>

at their worst. But we cannot, we must not use that as an excuse to end
the dream that began here. For then, the demons of our past will have
won. Instead, I want to look to the future and begin by honouring the
people responsible for our being here tonight. They represent all of us
at our best. <br/>
ARCHER: Up until about a hundred years ago, there was one question that
burned in every human, that made us study the stars and dream of
traveling to them, Are we alone? Our generation is privileged to know
the answer to that question. We are all explorers, driven to know
what's over the horizon, what's beyond our own shores. And yet, the
more I've experienced, the more I've learned that no matter how far we
travel, or how fast we get there, the most profound discoveries are not
necessarily beyond that next star. They're within us, woven into the
threads that bind us,
all of us, to each other. The final frontier begins in this hall. Let's
explore it together. <br/>

T'POL: She was important. <br/>
TUCKER: There's something else. I spoke with Phlox. It turns out there
was a flaw in the technique that Paxton's doctors used in the cloning
process. Human DNA and Vulcan DNA, Phlox says there's no medical reason
why they can't combine. So if a Vulcan and a human ever decided to have
a child, it'd probably be okay. And that's sort of comforting. <br/>

personal note - with a slight
rearrangement of the final scenes, it is my opinion that Enterprise
should have ended with Archer's speech. The next episode is totally
missable, unwarranted, and frankly even worse than Spock's Brain. And
that's saying something when you're a life-long Trek fan as
I am. </i> </font> </p>
