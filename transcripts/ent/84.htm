would not have been possible. <br/>

SOVAL: Deception has never been a stranger to this room. <br/>
V'LAS: I caution you. <br/>
SOVAL: One of our own members was responsible for bombing the Earth
embassy. An act we tried to blame on the Syrrannites. <br/>
V'LAS: That assessment was correct. Our investigation of Stel has
revealed he's a Syrrannite. <br/>
SOVAL: I find that difficult to accept. <br/>
V'LAS: Numerous documents were discovered in his home. The evidence is
irrefutable. Syrrannites were responsible, and they'll be dealt with
accordingly. Regarding the matter at hand, your position is terminated
immediately. You're to surrender all classified materials to the
Security Directorate before leaving. I remind you that your loyalty
oath is still in effect. A violation of that oath <br/>

T'PAU: I am T'Pau. <br/>
ARCHER: You murdered my friend, along with forty other people. <br/>
T'PAU: I had nothing to do with the destruction of your embassy. <br/>
T'POL: The evidence says you did. <br/>
T'PAU: I haven't left this desert for two years. What does that tell
you about your evidence? <br/>
ARCHER: It tells me that you're lying! <br/>
T'PAU: You have a lot to learn about Syrrannites. <br/>
ARCHER: You have a lot to learn about humans. We don't sit back and do
nothing while our people are attacked. <br/>
T'PAU: No, you traverse vast wastelands based on false information.
What did you plan to do when you found me, place me under arrest? <br/>
ARCHER: Something like that. <br/>

ARCHER: No. <br/>
T'PAU: To have crossed the Forge by yourselves, with the sand-fire
storms this time of year <br/>
T'POL: We met a Syrrannite. He helped us find shelter. <br/>
T'PAU: Who was this person? <br/>
ARCHER: His name was Arev. <br/>
T'POL: He was struck down by an electrical charge. <br/>
ARCHER: He didn't make it. <br/>
T'PAU: He's dead? Are you certain his name was Arev? <br/>

hand on my forehead. I felt something inside my head. <br/>
T'POL: Do you think he was trying to meld with you? <br/>

T'LES: I can't change what I've done. She doesn't deserve imprisonment.
I want her released. <br/>
T'PAU: Not until we've confirmed their story. <br/>
T'LES: My daughter wouldn't lie. <br/>
T'PAU: She's not merely your daughter. She's a member of Starfleet, and
Starfleet is allied with the High Command. They'll both remain where
they are until I'm satisfied they can be trusted. Search patrols are
flying day and night. <br/>

because you helped us? <br/>
SOVAL; I knew the risks. <br/>
TUCKER: There's got to be some way you can fight this. <br/>
SOVAL; I could protest, but it wouldn't accomplish anything. V'Las
isn't one to change his mind. <br/>
TUCKER: Who the hell put him in charge, anyway? <br/>
SOVAL: Our society rewards merit. V'Las has demonstrated a singular
talent for governing. <br/>
TUCKER: What are you going to do now? <br/>
SOVAL: You're referring to my career? I haven't given it much thought.
There's something more important we need to discuss. Have you made
contact with T'Pol or your Captain? <br/>
TUCKER: We can't reach them and they can't reach us. <br/>

T'LES: You must have questions for me. <br/>
T'POL: I can't understand how you could join these people. <br/>
T'LES: I've been growing disillusioned with Vulcan society for some
time. When I was forced to resign from the Academy, I began seriously
to question my beliefs. <br/>
T'POL: And this is where you came for answers? <br/>
T'LES: Syrrannites believe that Vulcans have strayed from the teachings
of Surak. Considering what the High Command has done in recent years,
the listening station at P'Jem, the suppression of dissent, our
position isn't so hard to accept. <br/>
T'POL: You could have told me all this when I came to visit. <br/>
T'LES: The High Command was just beginning to hunt down suspected
Syrrannites. I was afraid I would be next. I wanted to keep you out of
it. I know your marriage to Koss was for my sake. To help me regain my
post. <br/>
T'POL: I don't want your apologies, Mother. I want you to come back
with me. <br/>
T'LES: I can't do that. <br/>
T'POL: When you gave me that map, you knew I'd try to find you. <br/>
T'LES: I thought that if you could see what we were trying to
accomplish <br/>
T'POL: That I'd understand? That I'd join you? <br/>

dream. <br/>
SURAK: You're seeing the past through my eyes. <br/>
ARCHER: Syrran did something to me before he died. <br/>
SURAK: He chose you. You don't trust Vulcans, Captain. And, given your
experiences with them, I can't say I blame you. The culture you've come
to know isn't the one I helped to create. My people have strayed, and
someone must restore them to the path. <br/>
ARCHER: You've got the wrong man. <br/>
SURAK: Sorry, Captain. There's an Earth expression, We're stuck with
each other. Don't fight what's been given to you. Open your mind and

northeastern border of the Forge. <br/>
KUVAK: How accurate is this information? <br/>
V'LAS: It's based on data collected by search patrols. They've been
conducting missions for several days. We're going to bombard the camp
with photonic weapons. <br/>
KUVAK: Our goal isn't to exterminate these people. <br/>
V'LAS: Our goal is to maintain order. <br/>
KUVAK: They're in the deep desert. What possible harm could they do us?
<br/>
V'LAS: They've already destroyed an embassy. <br/>
KUVAK: Eventually, they're going to have to leave the Forge, and when
they do, we can apprehend them with little or no loss of life. <br/>
V'LAS: It's very likely that Syrran himself is inside the compound.
With one decisive thrust, we can cripple this insurgency, perhaps end
it. We can't let an opportunity like this pass us by. <br/>
KUVAK: A surgical strike could minimize the loss of life. <br/>

T'POL: Katras are nothing more than a myth. <br/>
T'LES: I used to think that, until I learned to open up my mind to
other possibilities. <br/>
T'PAU: If Syrran knew he was close to death, he would have tried to
transfer the katra to someone else. <br/>
ARCHER: I was near him when he died. <br/>
T'PAU: There is only one way to be certain. I have to meld with you. <br/>
ARCHER: I've had my fill of mind-melds. <br/>
T'PAU: The prospect doesn't appeal to me, either. I've never melded
with a human before. Your unchecked emotions will no doubt prove
distasteful. However, I ask your indulgence. <br/>

T'POL: Polycrystalline vessels, allegedly used by ancient Vulcans to
preserve katras. They were scanned, analyzed. One of the scientists
even attempted to meld with them. They found nothing to indicate the
presence of a katra. <br/>
ARCHER: The Vulcan Science Academy was just as sceptical about time
travel. <br/>
T'POL: Do you really believe you possess the living spirit of Surak
inside you? A man who died eighteen hundred years ago? <br/>
ARCHER: Not when you put it like that. <br/>
T'POL: There is a logical explanation. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm listening. <br/>
T'POL: Syrran melded with you before he died. What you're experiencing
is the residue of his thoughts. <br/>
ARCHER: So I'm suffering from a mind-meld hangover? <br/>
T'POL: I wouldn't characterise it quite that way, but essentially. <br/>
ARCHER: It feels like more than that. <br/>
T'POL: You have no basis for comparison. You've never undergone a
mind-meld before. <br/>
ARCHER: Seeing Surak is only a part of it. I could swear I've been here
before, in this sanctuary. It's like coming back to the house you grew
up in. <br/>
T'POL: Syrran spent a great deal of time here. <br/>

put something in my head. And I want it taken out. <br/>

T'PAU: Passed down through the ages, the katra of Surak, father of all
we hold true, lives on in this man. Let it now live on in me. <br/>

starts speaking in Vulcan. Archer seems to be in pain, then we join him
in another vision.) <br/>
ARCHER: Surak. <br/>
SURAK: Good to see you again, Captain. My appearance must be quite
disconcerting. I apologise. <br/>
ARCHER: Radiation sickness? <br/>
SURAK: We're paying a heavy price for our foolishness. Logic has not
won this day, but this day won't last forever. Logic is at the heart of
every Vulcan. Even as the ashes fall, my people are discovering a new
way. You can accomplish what Syrran could not. <br/>
ARCHER: But Syrran <br/>
SURAK: Was a Vulcan, and you're human. Which means you are untouched by
a culture that can no longer see its own imminent destruction. We
cannot let what happened to the Vulcans of my time take place again.
Find what my people have lost. Find the Kir'Shara. <br/>

HOSHI: Three ships closing on our position. We're being hailed. It's Administrator V'Las. <br/>
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: Why did you launch a shuttlepod? <br/>

V'LAS [on viewscreen]: You had no authorisation. Answer the question. <br/>
TUCKER: We're looking for our Captain. <br/>
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: Archer's on the surface? <br/>
TUCKER: He's in the Forge, searching for the Syrrannites. <br/>

out cold on the floor where he collapsed after the meld.) <br/>
T'LES: How is he? <br/>
T'POL: His breathing has stabilised, but his fever is still high. <br/>
T'LES: He agreed to the ritual. <br/>
T'POL: If he hadn't, you would have forced him. You claim that Surak's
teachings have been corrupted by the High Command, but you're no
different. <br/>
T'LES: There is a profound difference. <br/>
T'POL: You deceive yourself. <br/>
T'LES: T'Pol. <br/>

anything more to do with you. <br/>

ARCHER: It was important to Surak, and it's in there. <br/>
T'POL: What's a Kir'Shara? <br/>
T'PAU: An artefact. Syrran led us here to find it. <br/>
T'LES: If he knows where it is. <br/>
T'PAU: Telescopes have sighted three Vulcan cruisers in orbit over the
Forge. <br/>
T'LES: The High Command knows we're here. We should evacuate
immediately. <br/>

What does the High Command have against the Syrrannites? They went to a

ago. Captain Archer helped negotiate it. <br/>
SOVAL: Vulcan Intelligence claims the Andorians are developing a
weapon, possibly based on Xindi technology. <br/>

persuaded the High Command to launch a preemptive strike. <br/>
