ARCHER: We're pretty sure we've found a way in. I'm sending a crew in a
shuttlepod. <br/>
T'POL: The Spheres are controlled by a network of artificial
intelligence. This section houses the redundant memory core. It should
contain a significant amount of information. <br/>

DOLIM: We were impressed with your linguistic abilities. Aquatic is
difficult to master. I've heard it spoken my entire life but still, it
doesn't come easily to me. <br/>
HOSHI: Maybe you should have applied yourself more. <br/>
DOLIM: We have some encoded data we need translated. <br/>
HOSHI: I'm not a cryptologist. <br/>
DOLIM: I have confidence in your abilities. <br/>
HOSHI: That's very flattering, but you'll have to manage on your own. <br/>
DOLIM: If you refuse, we'll have no further use for you. Get her ready
for the procedure. <br/>
(Hoshi struggles as she's strapped into a nasty metal chair.) <br/>
LIEUTENANT: She's surprisingly strong-willed for a primate. <br/>
DOLIM: We'll see how defiant she is after our surgeons have finished
with her. We'll have the launch codes soon enough. </font></p>

T'POL: We need to access the data from this. Meet me in the
Command centre in half an hour. I'll assist you. <br/>
TRAVIS: What have we missed? <br/>
TUCKER: The Teptilians took the weapon. <br/>
TRAVIS: Have they launched it? <br/>
TUCKER: We don't know. The Captain's on his way to the surface, he
wants to figure out our next move. And they took Hoshi. She's gone. <br/>
TRAVIS: Who? <br/>
TUCKER: Reptilians, Insectoids, we don't know. They transported her off
the Bridge. <br/>
(The three leave.) <br/>
HAYES: Where's Corporal Hawkins? <br/>
REED: The Sphere had an automated defence mechanism. He was killed. I'm
sorry, Major. <br/>
HAYES: I'm sure you did everything you could. I'd appreciate a full
report. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: Where are they? <br/>
HUMANOID: We're trying to determine their location. It's difficult to
track them inside a vortex. <br/>
ARCHER: For all you know they could be heading to Earth. <br/>
JANNAR: They can't deploy the weapon. Not yet. <br/>
HUMANOID: Each of the five species has a set of commands to initiate
the arming sequence. Three of them are needed to activate the weapon. <br/>
JANNAR: They only have two. We obviously don't intent to give them
ours. <br/>
ARCHER: What about the Aquatics? <br/>
HUMANOID: Their actions aren't easy to predict, but so far they seem
determined not to take sides. <br/>
JANNAR: It's more likely the Reptilians and Insectoids will attempt to
bypass the command codes themselves. <br/>
HUMANOID: And that will take time. <br/>
ARCHER: They've abducted my Communications Officer. Up until now I
didn't know why. <br/>
JANNAR: You believe they'll use her to decrypt the arming sequence? <br/>
ARCHER: She'll never co-operate. <br/>
HUMANOID: She may not have a choice. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Command centre]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: This could be a command subroutine. <br/>
TUCKER: And it could be a letter to Santa Claus. I wouldn't mind having
Hoshi here right now. <br/>
T'POL: We'll have to make do without her. <br/>
TUCKER: I just hope she's okay. <br/>
T'POL: We're here to analyse this data, not speculate on Ensign Sato's
fate. <br/>
TUCKER: You okay? <br/>
T'POL: I'm fond of Hoshi as well, but we can't allow her situation to
become a distraction. <br/>
ARCHER: Any luck? <br/>
T'POL: There's a great deal of data to analyse, but we've made some
progress. We know the Spheres are connected by a subspace energy grid,
but four of them appear to be integral to that connection. <br/>
TUCKER: Closest one's here. We've designated it Sphere Forty One. <br/>
ARCHER: Integral how? <br/>
T'POL: I believe they act as control Spheres, allowing the network to
operate in concert. <br/>
ARCHER: If we can damage one of them, would it disrupt the entire grid?
<br/>
TUCKER: Maybe. It also might have no effect. We just don't have enough
information yet. <br/>
ARCHER: Keep at it. <br/>
TUCKER: Aye, sir. </font></p>

Wait. After the injection, the parasites will invade your neocortex.
Once they begin reconfiguring your synaptic pathways you'll me much
more compliant. Before your primate brain is too badly damaged to
understand, I want to thank you for helping us destroy your world. <br/>

wouldn't have found them. <br/>
HUMANOID: They're less than four light years from here. <br/>
REED: Why have they stopped? They could have been half way to Earth by
now. <br/>
HUMANOID: They're attempting to arm the weapon. The propulsion system
has to be offline to do it. <br/>
ARCHER: How quickly can we get there? <br/>
JANNAR: That wouldn't be wise. They've been joined by at least a dozen
vessels. <br/>
ARCHER: You have nearly as many ships. <br/>
HUMANOID: You may have noticed that Reptilians and Insectoids are more
belligerent than we are. Their ships are armed accordingly. <br/>
JANNAR: We're no match for them. <br/>
REED: We've been out-gunned before, sir. We did not come all this way
to give up without a fight. <br/>
ARCHER: Would the Aquatics be a match for them? <br/>
HUMANOID: Their ships are extremely powerful, but they've seen your
evidence. They're not convinced. <br/>
ARCHER: That was before the reptilians murdered Degra and stole the
weapon. We're looking at civil war. Can they afford to sit back and do
nothing? Let me talk to them. </font></p>

time to dissolve the Council. <br/>
AQUATIC: (something) <br/>
HUMANOID: So we should leave our fate in the hands of the Reptilians
and the Insectoids? <br/>
AQUATIC: (something) <br/>
HUMANOID: I disagree. The evidence the humans provided can't be
ignored. <br/>
AQUATIC: (something, then the screen goes blank.)<br/>
ARCHER: I didn't quite catch that last part. <br/>
HUMANOID: They have agreed to meet with us, but don't expect much,

HUMANOID: You have to deal with the Aquatics on their terms. <br/>
JANNAR: They're extremely deliberate in everything they do. <br/>
ARCHER: You all right? <br/>
JANNAR: My species doesn't like the water. <br/>
HUMANOID: They're here. <br/>
ARCHER: Thank you for seeing me. I'm afraid my Communications Officer
was abducted by the Reptilians. <br/>
AQUATIC: That is regrettable, but her presence is no longer necessary.
We've had time to study your language. <br/>
ARCHER: Then I'll get to the point. We need your help. <br/>
AQUATIC 2: We made our position clear. The evidence is intriguing but
far from conclusive. <br/>
AQUATIC: We require more time to evaluate it. <br/>
ARCHER: And if my world gets torn to rubble in the meantime? <br/>
AQUATIC: The Reptilians and the Insectoids cannot deploy the weapon on
their own. <br/>
HUMANOID: That may not be true. <br/>
ARCHER: I believe they took my officer to help them decipher a third
launch code. After all your deliberations, you may find a decision's
been made without you. <br/>
AQUATIC2: This changes nothing. <br/>
AQUATIC: Just because the Reptilians choose to act rashly does not mean
we will do the same. <br/>
ARCHER: So you'd rather sit back and do nothing <br/>
JANNAR: Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: While they condemn all five of your species to extinction. <br/>
AQUATIC2: You may return to your ship. You'll be informed of our
decision. <br/>
ARCHER: One last question. Have these Guardians told you where you'll
establish your new home world? The ones humans are destined to destroy?
Is it here, in the Expanse? In case you haven't noticed, the Spheres
are turning it into a transdimensional wasteland. None of you will be
able to survive. <br/>
(The Aquatics swim away.) <br/>
ARCHER: You say the Guardians have helped you. Have they ever tried to
disable the Spheres? Because we've found a way. <br/>

have to live with your guilt for long. <br/>

me to become slightly emotional. <br/>

BUILDER: Excellent. Deploy it immediately. <br/>
DOLIM: As soon as we decrypt the third launch code. We've encountered
some difficulties. <br/>
BUILDER: The longer you delay, the more likely the time lines will
shift against you. <br/>
DOLIM: Then perhaps you can provide more of your valuable assistance.
Help us get the code. <br/>
BUILDER: That's not possible. <br/>
DOLIM: It should be a simple matter to peer into the past, extract the
necessary data. <br/>
BUILDER: We only detect large fluctuations in the timescape. The fine
details are obscured. <br/>
DOLIM: Really? You've seen more than enough detail to learn how to
meddle in our affairs, to turn the Xindi species against each other. <br/>
BUILDER: Everything we've done has been to protect the Xindi. <br/>
DOLIM: Then finish what you've started, if it's within your power. <br/>
BUILDER: The time lines are in constant flux. Many of them favour the
Primates and the Arboreals. Some even favour the humans. Unless that's

HUMANOID: It's only been three hours. The Council once needed to
resolve a simple logistical matter. It took the Aquatics six days to
agree to attend the meeting. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm surprised you were ever able to get anything done. <br/>
HUMANOID: On the contrary. Their prudence was usually the only thing
that kept the Council from dissolving into chaos. That's why Degra had
them build the weapon. He didn't want the reptilians and insectoids to
have too much control. <br/>
ARCHER: That's actually something I wanted to discuss with you. If
we're successful, and we destroy the weapon <br/>
HUMANOID: What's to prevent us from building another one? I knew Degra
for many years. He could be difficult, uncompromising. We argued often.
For instance, when he insisted that we meet with you. But when Degra
spoke only a fool would ignore him. He believed there was a future
between your people and ours. When this is over, I intend to see if he
was right. <br/>

take a team aboard to destroy it. I don't imagine the reptilians will
