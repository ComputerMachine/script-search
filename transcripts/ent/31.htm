ARCHER: It's incredible we're still in one piece. <br/>
TUCKER: If that mine had hit another metre to the left. We can't
polarise the port bow plating until those breaches are sealed. <br/>
ARCHER: What's your guess. <br/>
TUCKER: Assuming we can find some tritanium alloy? Three or four
months. And with this kind of damage the best I can give you is warp
two, maybe two point one. <br/>
ARCHER: In other words, we're a decade away from Jupiter Station. What
about the transceiver array? <br/>
TUCKER: The subspace antenna's damaged. All we've got is short-range. <br/>
ARCHER: We've answered enough calls for help over the past year. It's
time someone returned the favour. <br/>
TUCKER: You serious? <br/>
ARCHER: Archer to Ensign Sato. <br/>
HOSHI [OC]: Go ahead, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: I want you to get started on a general distress call.

And rest. <br/>
REED: It can't be ethical to cause a patient this much pain. <br/>
PHLOX: It's unethical to harm a patient. I can inflict as much pain as
I like. A positive attitude is vital to the healing process. The more
you complain, the longer your recovery is likely to take. <br/>
REED: When will I be able to return to duty? <br/>
PHLOX: Another week, possibly two. <br/>

me to apply a few more Regulan Blood Worms. <br/>

Enterprise. Thank you for responding. <br/>
TELLARITE [OC]: (very crackly, barely audible) How may we be of

rendezvous with us, we'd be happy to discuss <br/>

T'POL: We have received a set of co-ordinates. <br/>
ARCHER: What do you know about these Tellarites? <br/>
T'POL: They're not the most agreeable species, but they're usually
trustworthy. The co-ordinates are three and a half days away at warp
two. <br/>
ARCHER: I think it's worth a look. <br/>
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.<br/>(They arrive at the repair station.) <br/>
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer of the starship Enterprise. We need to
make some repairs. I was told you might be willing to help us. We'd be
grateful for any assistance you could offer. Please respond. <br/>
HOSHI: Nothing. <br/>
ARCHER: Biosigns? <br/>
T'POL: None that I can detect. <br/>
HOSHI: Maybe it's abandoned. <br/>
TUCKER: We might be able to board it, salvage some of the materials we
need. <br/>
ARCHER: It doesn't seem that Enterprise could fit inside those docking
berths. What's it look like inside? <br/>
T'POL: I'm detecting a liquid helium atmosphere. The temperature's two
hundred and seventy degrees below zero. (a bright light sweeps the
bridge) A bio-molecular probe. <br/>
TRAVIS: Sir. <br/>
(One of the two docking bays opens and expands to receive the starship.)
<br/>
TUCKER: It's reconfiguring to fit the saucer section. <br/>
T'POL: The liquid helium's being replaced by a warmer oxygen-nitrogen
atmosphere. <br/>
HOSHI: Still no response to our hails. <br/>
T'POL: It appears an invitation's been extended. <br/>
ARCHER: They need to work a little on their hospitality. <br/>

Enterprise and follow the flashing lights into a pristine white space

the ship in the centre of it.) <br/>
TUCKER: They've isolated every hull breach, every damaged system. I'll
be damned. We scratched the hull right here, a year ago. I bumped it
with the inspection pod, remember? <br/>
ARCHER: I thought I told you to have that repainted. <br/>

wasn't the only thing they probed. I think that's Malcolm. That's where
his left leg was injured. <br/>

well. <br/>

ARCHER: We can give them either three warp coils,
five deuterium injectors or two hundred litres of warp plasma. <br/>
TUCKER: I wouldn't recommend giving up any hardware we can't replace. <br/>
ARCHER: Plasma? <br/>
TUCKER: I think we can spare it. <br/>
ARCHER: If we agree to these terms, how long will the repairs take? <br/>
COMPUTER: Time to completion, thirty four point two Earth hours. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm telling you, the boys at Jupiter Station would take three
months. <br/>
T'POL: It's a fair exchange. <br/>
COMPUTER: Select a method of compensation to begin the repair process. <br/>
(Archer picks the plasma option.) <br/>
COMPUTER: Compensation will be due when the repairs are completed. Your
vessel will then disengage immediately. All personnel are required to
vacate areas that are undergoing reconstruction. <br/>
ARCHER: Look at this. <br/>
T'POL: It's our repair schedule. <br/>

T'POL: A matter energy
converter. <br/>
TUCKER: It could be a transporter. An awfully small one. <br/>
T'POL: I believe it's a molecular synthesiser of some kind. Similar to
a protein resequencer, but far more advanced. Water, cold. <br/>(A glass of
water with a couple of ice cubes materialises, and she sips it.) <br/>T'POL: I saw a
similar device on a Tarkalean vessel. It was capable of replicating
almost any inanimate object. <br/>
TUCKER: If we had one of these in Engineering we could make all the
spare parts we need. I wonder what else is on the menu. One pan-fried
catfish. <br/>(A plate, knife and fork, fish, twist of lemon, greens and two
other items of food appear.) <br/>TUCKER: Smells like the real thing. <br/>(He tastes it.) <br/>
ARCHER: Well? <br/>
TUCKER: Not bad. <br/>
ARCHER: I doubt there's a catfish within a hundred and thirty light
years. <br/>
T'POL: It's genome is stored in Enterprise's computer as is the recipe.
The station evidently scanned our database. <br/>
ARCHER: It would have been nice to have been asked. I can only imagine
what else this thing knows about us. <br/>
TUCKER: Captain, you've got to try this. <br/>

PHLOX: That's the third time you've asked. <br/>
REED: You didn't answer me the first two times. <br/>
PHLOX: It's remarkable. Your cells are regenerating at an exponential
rate. Do you see how it's using a cytokinetic enzyme to stimulate the
cell division? <br/>
REED: Lovely. <br/>
PHLOX: (almost drooling) I could certainly use a device like this.
Perhaps the Captain could negotiate a trade of some sort. <br/>(The device

ARCHER: They even fixed the squeak in the floor. I was starting to
wonder if we had a gremlin under the deck plating. <br/>(T'Pol looks
puzzled.) <br/>ARCHER: A mythical creature. British pilots used to blame them for
problems they couldn't explain. <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps I should scan for one. <br/>
ARCHER: That won't be necessary. Is Trip happy with how the repairs are
going? <br/>
T'POL: He says they're exceeding Starfleet specifications. <br/>

These repairs are one hell of a bargain at only two hundred litres of
warp plasma, don't you think? <br/>
T'POL: Not every culture is based on the acquisition of wealth. The
station's builders could simply have been interested in helping others.
<br/>
ARCHER: What happened to them? They could have at least left a message.
Thanks for stopping by. <br/>

TUCKER: I know how he must have felt. I saw an entire transtator
assembly replaced in fifteen minutes. It would have taken my crew a
week. With this kind of technology Starfleet could build ships that
maintain themselves. They wouldn't need Chief Engineers. Or Tactical
Officers. <br/>
REED: A starship without a Tactical Officer? I can't say I see the
point. <br/>
TUCKER: You'd think a computer that can do all this would have to be
pretty big. Our computer's the most advanced in the fleet and it's
three decks high. <br/>
REED: I suppose you're right. <br/>
TUCKER: So where is it? <br/>
REED: I don't follow. <br/>
TUCKER: I ran a scan of the station a few hours ago. These are the
docking berths. We're here. This is the diagnostic room. <br/>

barely half the size of this one. <br/>

Ensign Travis Mayweather. Human male. Weight, seventy two kilograms.
Age, twenty six Earth years. Far too young to be on this table.
Cellular decay suggests that death occurred at approximately twenty
three thirty hours. Preliminary cause of death, ventricular
fibrillation induced by an isolytic shock. The vascular system appears
to have functioned as a conduit for the discharge. The musculature
shows extensive necrosis along the conductive pathway. There are
subcutaneous burns over approximately twelve percent of the body.

multiple thermal fractures. Computer, pause. Ensign? This is not an
ideal time. <br/>

PHLOX: It's different when it's someone you know personally. <br/>(He pulls
back the curtain for her.) <br/>
HOSHI: I was hoping it was another one of his practical jokes. Travis
called me down to decon a few weeks ago. He said that he brought some
kind of gelatinous lifeform aboard. He said it might be sentient, that
the Captain needed me to figure out how to communicate with it. <br/>
PHLOX: I don't recall that. <br/>
HOSHI: There was no lifeform. It was only strawberry gelatine. I told
him I was going to get him back. I'm sorry. <br/>

isolytic shock instantly impairs the nervous. That's odd. <br/>(He looks at the

would have multiplied. I believe that someone, or something, has
abducted Ensign Mayweather and left this facsimile in his place. <br/>
ARCHER: Apparently bulkheads aren't the only thing this station can
replicate. <br/>
PHLOX: It's ironic, in a way. The station can duplicate a dead human
body in all its exquisite detail, yet a living, simple, one-celled
organism is beyond its capability. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: I've located Ensign Mayweather's parents. <br/>
ARCHER: You'd better hold off. Their son may still be alive. You and
Trip managed to get pretty far inside the station. How close do you
think you got to the computer core? <br/>
REED: We were within twenty metres when we tripped the sensors. <br/>
ARCHER: Think you could find a way to get past them? <br/>
REED: I believe so. <br/>
T'POL: Our repairs will be complete in nineteen minutes. The station's
expecting us to depart. <br/>
ARCHER: Bridge to Engineering. <br/>

Enterprise's hull, Trip pushes a trolley with four plasma canisters
through the doorway.) <br/>

<br/>(Which slides out from the wall.) <br/>
TUCKER: Hold on. Hold on. There's a couple of problems we need to
discuss first. Now, I'm not real happy with the quality of some of your
work. Are you listening to me? <br/>
COMPUTER: Please place your compensation on the transport platform. <br/>
TUCKER: I've looked at the bolt couplings you used to attach the new
hull plating. I'm afraid they're not up to Starfleet specs. And the
subspace amplifier you repaired? We're picking up distortion on all the
high-band frequencies. <br/>
COMPUTER: Please place your compensation on the transport platform. <br/>
TUCKER: We're not paying until we sort this out. <br/>
(Archer pulls T'Pol up into the ventilation shaft.) <br/>
TUCKER: What guarantee do I have that these duranium pins won't fly out
the instant we jump to warp? <br/>
COMPUTER: Your inquiry was not recognised. <br/>
TUCKER: On my world, we have an expression. The customer's always
right. Maybe you should make that part of your programme. I want to
know how someone files a grievance around here. </font></p>

forward to the iris, sets off the alarm and gets beamed out to the
Bridge while Archer and T'Pol take readings. Then they use their phase
pistols.) </font></p>

things to deal with. <br/>(He runs away. T'Pol disables the transporter sequence, then
gets the iris open by firing at it. They make their way out of the
shaft into a more shabby part of the station, where people are draped
over benches hung from the ceiling at various heights, and hooked up to
a what looks like a central unit.) </font></p>

severe neurological damage. <br/>

ARCHER: On his way to Sickbay. What's our status? <br/>
TUCKER: It's been better. The station's got us by the thrusters. (sits
at helm) <br/>
ARCHER: Impulse engines? <br/>
TUCKER: Offline. <br/>
REED: We're losing main power. <br/>
HOSHI: Life support's failing. <br/>
ARCHER: Malcolm, I think it's time we deliver our payment. <br/>
(Reed uses a remote control to set off a detonator next to the plasma
containers in the station's diagnostic room. Boom!) <br/>
REED: It did some heavy damage, sir. Power levels are dropping, but the
plasma hasn't ignited the O2 conduits yet. <br/>
ARCHER: It needs to reach three thousand degrees, Malcolm. Be patient. <br/>
REED: Yes, sir. <br/>
(A pause, then the ship starts to shake.) <br/>
REED: I'm reading secondary explosions throughout the station. <br/>
(The station starts to fall apart, and Enterprise's light come back to
full brightness.) <br/>
T'POL: Command functions are coming back online. <br/>
ARCHER: Engines? <br/>
TUCKER: Impulse and thrusters. <br/>
REED: One of those arms is still locked onto the hull. <br/>
T'POL: If we don't disengage soon, we'll be incinerated. <br/>
ARCHER: Full thrusters. <br/>
TUCKER: It's no good. And if I fired up the impulse engines we'd
probably tear off half the saucer section. <br/>
ARCHER: Can you launch a torpedo? <br/>
REED: At this range, sir, I wouldn't recommend it. <br/>
ARCHER: I agree, but I don't think we have much choice. <br/>
(A torpedo is launched at the securing arm, and smashes through half of
it.) <br/>
ARCHER: One more, Lieutenant! <br/>(This one impacts properly and explodes.)

How're you feeling? <br/>
TRAVIS: Much better, sir. Thank you. The doctor told me what happened.
I'm not sure I understand. <br/>
ARCHER: We're still trying to figure that out for ourselves. <br/>
PHLOX: I may be able to shed some light on the subject. <br/>(He hands over a
piece of metal.) <br/>PHLOX: It seems to be some kind of interface designed to
convert neural impulses into binary code. Essentially, the station was
using your brain to enhance its processing power. <br/>
TRAVIS: Why would it do that? <br/>
T'POL: The cerebral cortex is the most sophisticated computer known to
exist. <br/>
TRAVIS: What about all those other people? <br/>
PHLOX: According to T'Pol's scans most of them had been there for
years. The damage to their brains was irreversible. Fortunately, you
were removed before any permanent injury occurred. <br/>
ARCHER: When can I have my helmsman back? <br/>
PHLOX: I'd like to observe him for another twenty four hours, if you
don't mind. <br/>(Phlox leaves them.) <br/>
ARCHER: Captain's mess, Friday morning, oh eight hundred. Don't be
late. <br/>

debris, a welding arm is at work.) </font> </p>
