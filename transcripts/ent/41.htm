SHRAN: Report. <br/>
TARAH: (the wonderful <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0686442" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" target="_blank">Suzie Plaxson</a>) The Imperial Guard
will die at their posts, but <br/>
SHRAN: I know my men are willing to die. I want to hear their chances
of surviving. <br/>
TARAH: We're holding our positions for now, but the enemy has deployed
new units here and here. <br/>
SHRAN: They're looking for a weakness. <br/>
TARAH: They may have found it. We've taken more casualties. <br/>
SHRAN: I've received a communiqué. The Vulcans want to discuss terms
for a cease fire. <br/>
TARAH: Have you ever known a Vulcan who wouldn't lie to get what he
wanted? <br/>
SHRAN: There is another option. Someone I've dealt with. A pinkskin.
He's proven to be quite even-handed in dealing with Vulcans. His name
is Archer. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ready room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: You're sure he wants me? <br/>
FORREST [on monitor]: Ambassador Soval said your presence is crucial to
resolving the crisis. <br/>
ARCHER: What's this planet called again? <br/>
FORREST [on monitor]: The Vulcan name is Paan Mokar. The Andorians call
it Weytahn. It's on the frontier between their systems. Both sides
claim it belongs to them. They've nearly gone to war over it twice in
the past century. <br/>
ARCHER: How do they expect me to help settle a conflict they haven't
been able to resolve in a hundred years? <br/>
FORREST [on monitor]: Soval says you'll be fully briefed when you
arrive. Jonathan, this is the first time the Vulcans have asked for our
help. You're the closest thing we have to an ambassador out there. You
know how important this could be. <br/>
ARCHER: We'll get there as fast as we can. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Tucker watches his glass vibrating on the
table.) <br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TUCKER: I don't like pushing the engines this
hard. The injectors are
running at a hundred and ten percent. <br/>
T'POL: They're rated for one hundred and twenty. <br/>
TUCKER: And my underwear is flame-retardant. That doesn't mean I'm
going to light myself on fire to prove it. <br/>
ARCHER: I think we'll make it in one piece, Trip. I've been reading
about Paan Mokar in the Vulcan database. It doesn't say a lot. Class D,
not much bigger than Earth's moon, claimed by the Vulcans in 2097. <br/>
TUCKER: Class D? That's uninhabitable. Why are you fighting over it? <br/>
T'POL: When the Andorians first arrived a century ago, they began to
terraform the planet. Once an atmosphere was developed, they
established a settlement. <br/>
ARCHER: If it was unclaimed at the time, why would there be a problem? <br/>
T'POL: Its sole value is its strategic location near Vulcan space. <br/>
ARCHER: They were setting up a military base? <br/>
T'POL: It was the only logical conclusion. <br/>
TUCKER: Was there any evidence? <br/>
T'POL: How much evidence would you need if the Klingons decided to set
up a colony on Pluto? <br/>
TUCKER: That's not the same thing. <br/>
T'POL: The Andorians refused to let the High Command inspect the
colony. So, they annexed Paan Mokar to protect their territory. <br/>
ARCHER: What happened to the Andorian colonists? <br/>
T'POL: They were removed. <br/>
TUCKER: By force. <br/>
T'POL: They left the High Command little choice. A surveillance
satellite was put into orbit to monitor the agreement. The planet's
been deserted for nearly a century. <br/>
ARCHER: Until now. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Captain's Starlog, supplemental. In the three days
it's taken us to reach Paan Mokar, the situation has grown considerably

TUCKER: Unbelievable. I damn near burn up the warp reactor getting
here, and they make us wait. <br/>
(Soval and Muroc enter, with T'Pol.) <br/>
ARCHER: Welcome aboard, Ambassador. <br/>
SOVAL: Thank you, Captain. This is Sub-commander Muroc. <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pol has been filling me in on the situation here, but I still
have a lot of questions. <br/>
SOVAL: (sitting) If you don't mind, Captain, I have a question of my
own. Why would an officer of the Andorian Imperial Guard personally
request your involvement? <br/>
ARCHER: I don't understand. I was told you asked for me. <br/>
SOVAL: I'm involved in extremely difficult and dangerous negotiations.
I don't consider your presence here an asset. <br/>
ARCHER: If that's how you feel, we'll gladly continue with our mission.
<br/>
SOVAL: Six days ago, an Andorian regimental commander named Shran
landed a force on Paan Mokar and occupied the settlement. <br/>
ARCHER: Shran. <br/>
SOVAL: Naturally, we attempted to enforce the Treaty of 2097. <br/>
TUCKER: Naturally. <br/>
MUROC: We've regained control of half the colony, but two dozen Vulcans
have been wounded and three have been taken hostage. <br/>
SOVAL: Shran has agreed to discuss terms for their safe return, but
only if you act as mediator. For some reason, he finds you trustworthy.
<br/>
ARCHER: You're asking for my help? <br/>
SOVAL: Yes, Captain, I'm asking for your help. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll see what I can do. <br/>
SOVAL: Forgive my candor, but that's hardly reassuring. The last time
you dealt with the Andorians, a Vulcan intelligence site was
compromised and a priceless monastery destroyed. Sub-commander Muroc
will accompany you to represent our interests. <br/>
ARCHER: Obviously, I'm here at the request of the Andorians. Shran
believes he can trust me. I don't intend to prove him wrong by going
down there with a Vulcan officer in tow. If you insist I bring a Vulcan
along, I'll take the one I know I can trust. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: You wanted to see me, Doc? <br/>
PHLOX: Yes. This planet is home to a rather pernicious mutagenic
pathogen, and I'll need to bombard your immune system with analeptic
radiation to protect you while you're on the surface. <br/>
ARCHER: Bombard. <br/>
PHLOX: It's quite painless, I assure you. <br/>
ARCHER: What about T'Pol? <br/>
PHLOX: Vulcan physiology isn't affected by the pathogen. Shall we? <br/>
(Archer enters the Decon Chamber and Phlox stands at the window. A
purple light comes on.) <br/>
PHLOX: This should only take a moment. If I may ask, how did your first
meeting with the Vulcans go? <br/>
ARCHER: Warm and friendly as ever. <br/>
PHLOX: Ironic. They weren't overly enthusiastic about you taking
command of Enterprise in the first place, and now your presence is
crucial to their interests. <br/>
ARCHER: It's crucial to ours, too. Maybe we're not out here to just
scan comets and meet new species. Maybe we're out here to prove that
humanity is ready to join a much larger community. I intend to do that,
whether the Vulcans like it or not. <br/>
PHLOX: All finished. <br/>
(The purple light goes off.) <br/>
PHLOX: Captain, I served as a
medic in the Denobulan infantry. If I learned anything from that
experience, it's that battlefields are unpredictable places, even under
a flag of truce. Be careful. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Shortly after launching from Enterprise. Archer
is piloting.) <br/>
ARCHER: We've lost the navigational sensors, and the comm. <br/>
T'POL: It's the Andorian jamming signal. I'm entering the landing
coordinates they gave us. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's hope they're accurate. <br/>
T'POL: Did you have a chance to read the Territorial Compromise? <br/>
ARCHER: I glanced at it. <br/>
T'POL: The Compromise is at the heart of this dispute. It's worth your
attention. <br/>
ARCHER: It's twelve hundred pages long. <br/>
T'POL: Did you glance at any of the other materials I sent to your
quarters? V'Lar's treatise on negotiating tactics is the definitive
text on the subject. <br/>
ARCHER: I got all of it. V'Lar's treatise, the Revised Intersystem
Agreement, the High Command briefing on the Border Incursions of 2112.
I was up till two a.m. <br/>
T'POL: Glancing. <br/>
ARCHER: Are you trying to tell me something? That maybe I'm not
prepared for this? <br/>
T'POL: Ambassador Soval clearly believes you'll fail. I was hoping some
advance preparation would help you prove him wrong. <br/>
ARCHER: Thanks, but I doubt I'm going to impress Shran by quoting
Vulcan treaties. <br/>
T'POL: I assume you have a strategy? <br/>
ARCHER: The first thing is to convince Shran that he can trust me. <br/>
T'POL: And then? <br/>
ARCHER: We're just going to have to play it by ear. </font></p>

TARAH: Don't move, Vulcan. <br/>
T'POL: Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: We're not armed. <br/>
(More weapons are aimed at them from all
angles.) <br/>
ARCHER: I'm Captain Jonathan Archer. I'm here to see Commander Shran. <br/>
TARAH: He's expecting you, without a Vulcan escort. <br/>
ARCHER: I wasn't told to come alone. This is my Science Officer. She
helped expose the Vulcan listening post at P'Jem. I thought Shran might
enjoy seeing her again. <br/>

ARCHER: I imagined my first diplomatic mission would involve sitting
around a big table, toasting with champagne, signing things with lots
of pens. <br/>
SHRAN: The pinkskin sense of humour. My apologies for the security
precautions. <br/>
TARAH: We can never be too vigilant when it comes to Vulcans. <br/>
ARCHER: They say the same thing about you. <br/>
SHRAN: I'm sure they do. We're aggressive, illogical. <br/>
ARCHER: Prove them wrong. <br/>
SHRAN: That's why you're here, Captain. To help us do just that. I've
dealt with the Vulcans twice before, where you were involved. Both
times you handled the situation without prejudice. <br/>
ARCHER: I hope I can help again, but the first thing I need is to see
the hostages. <br/>
TARAH: Hostages? Criminals take hostages. Kidnappers looking for a
ransom take hostages. I assume you're referring to the enemy soldiers
we captured. <br/>
ARCHER: The Vulcans want to know they're all right. <br/>
SHRAN: They haven't been harmed. <br/>
(He takes them to look into a room where three Vulcans are tied up.) <br/>
ARCHER: Are you all right? <br/>
TARAH: When they attacked us, two of my men were badly wounded. <br/>(She shuts
the door again.) <br/>TARAH: They're lucky we didn't kill them. <br/>
T'POL: You provoked this situation when you violated the Territorial
Compromise. <br/>TARAH: Only a Vulcan could call a hundred years of
oppression a compromise. You annexed a planet that belongs to us,
herded our people into refugee camps. <br/>
T'POL: After you set up a military outpost here. <br/>
SHRAN: As you can see, Captain, even after a hundred years, this
situation still evokes anger on both sides. We will release our
prisoners on the following conditions. Immediate withdrawal of all
Vulcan military forces, the so-called compromise is to be rescinded,
and the Vulcans must concede irrevocable sovereignty of Weytahn to
Andoria. <br/>
ARCHER: You don't expect them to agree to all that. <br/>
TARAH: I told you. He's a puppet of the Vulcans. <br/>
ARCHER: For the record, the Vulcan High Command doesn't like me very
much, and, frankly, the feeling is mutual. If all you need is someone
to deliver your list of demands, find somebody else. I've got other
things to do. <br/>
SHRAN: The Vulcans always say they're ready to talk, but it amounts to
nothing. Treaty negotiations that drag on for years. I want to speak to
Soval. Somebody who can deal with the situation without having to check
with his superiors. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll see what I can do. <br/>
SHRAN: Here. On my terms. <br/>
ARCHER: That might be a little difficult. <br/>
TARAH: This is pointless. <br/>
ARCHER: But not impossible. The thing is, he's going to want something
in return. <br/>
SHRAN: Haven't they already taken enough? <br/>
ARCHER: I'm talking about a gesture, something to show you're serious.
I came down here to see about the hostages. Why don't you let them go? <br/>
TARAH: And give away our only advantage? <br/>
SHRAN: No. <br/>
ARCHER: Release two of them, then. Keep the other one until after
you've met with Soval. <br/>
SHRAN: One, as a show of our good faith. </font></p>

SOVAL: And in exchange, you'll deliver me into their hands? I'm sure
the Andorians were impressed with your negotiating skills. <br/>
ARCHER: They want to talk to you, not kidnap you. <br/>
SOVAL: If I agree to a meeting, it's simply legitimises their position.
<br/>
ARCHER: And if you don't, these negotiations end before they begin. <br/>
MUROC: That may happen sooner than you realise. While you were on the
surface, we detected three Andorian vessels approaching. They'll be
here in less than five hours. <br/>
SOVAL: They probably intend to re-supply their troops on the surface.
We won't allow that. <br/>
T'POL: Engaging an Andorian vessel could be construed as an act of war.

go down there if you won't listen to my advice? <br/>

accept it. <br/>

willing to sit down and talk. The ball's in your court now. <br/>

discovered this planet. We made it livable. It belongs to us. Don't
worry, it'll be ours again. <br/>
TARAH: How? By talking? We've been trying that for a hundred years, and
it's gotten us nowhere. They stall and lie and make promises they never
intend to keep. We came here to fight. Why back down now? <br/>

anything about them except that they're friends of the Vulcans. <br/>

kilometres. <br/>

SOVAL: Are you that naive? Shran is using you. <br/>
ARCHER: This is a man who couldn't sleep because he thought he owed me
something. I don't believe he asked me to come a dozen light years just
so I could lead you into a trap. And right now it seems like the best
thing to do is to get a cease-fire in place. The Andorians won't agree
to that until they talk to you in person. I managed to keep us on

SHRAN: They are devious, but I doubt even they would go that far. <br/>

ARCHER: If we keep moving this way, we should be (weapons fire) Down! <br/>
SOVAL: Not quite the warm welcome you expected, Captain? <br/>
ARCHER: They're not shooting at us. <br/>
T'POL: The Vulcan units must be advancing their positions. <br/>
SOVAL: We should try to make contact with them. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't recommend sticking your neck out right now. <br/>
SOVAL: What do you recommend? Wandering through these ruins until we
find an Andorian soldier, and trust he's been informed not to shoot us
on sight? <br/>
ARCHER: I'll take a look. Stay here. <br/>
T'POL: Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: That's an order. No offence, but my ears are less likely to
draw fire than yours. <br/>(He leaves.) <br/>
SOVAL: What is their fixation with our ears? <br/>
T'POL: I believe they're envious. <br/>
SOVAL: Do you realise you've picked up a slight human accent? You were
one of the most promising members of my staff, T'Pol. If you'd stayed
in San Francisco, you'd be the Assistant Counsel by now. You might even
have a diplomatic posting of your own. <br/>
T'POL: I am aware of that. <br/>
SOVAL: Then why have you remained on Enterprise? <br/>
T'POL: We believed they needed our help when they first developed warp
drive. That hasn't changed. <br/>
SOVAL: Captain Archer's record is evidence of that, but there are
others who can assist them. <br/>
T'POL: I find the work gratifying. <br/>
SOVAL: Gratification is an emotional indulgence. You disagreed with our
recommendation that Archer's mission be cancelled after the tragedy at
Paraaga Two. Why? <br/>
T'POL: I was onboard Enterprise at the time. I felt my opinion would be
welcomed. <br/>
SOVAL: You believed you knew better than the High Command? That sounds
a great deal like another emotion, arrogance. Perhaps it's time for you
to consider another assignment. <br/>
T'POL: Just because Captain Archer has earned my respect doesn't mean I
have been contaminated by his emotions. <br/>(Archer comes running back.) <br/>T'POL: Did
you make contact? <br/>
ARCHER: No. They're pulling back. Let's keep moving. </font></p>

TUCKER: You have something? <br/>
HOSHI: I can't be sure. You see this EM differential here? <br/>
TUCKER: That's the Captain? <br/>
HOSHI: It's definitely a biosign. I'm ninety percent sure it's human. <br/>
TUCKER: At least we know he's alive. Where is he? <br/>
HOSHI: I need another hour. <br/>
TUCKER: What's the status on those Andorian ships? <br/>
TRAVIS: They just dropped out of warp. They'll be here in thirteen
minutes. <br/>
REED: I think the Vulcans see them, too. They're breaking orbit.
Probably giving themselves room to manoeuvre. <br/>
TUCKER: Put the ship on Tactical Alert. </font></p>

help him away.) <br/>ARCHER: Over there. <br/>(They take cover.) <br/>
T'POL: Those are Andorian weapons. <br/>
ARCHER: Hold your fire! <br/>
(They don't.) <br/>
ARCHER: How is he? <br/>
T'POL: It isn't life-threatening but he needs medical attention. <br/>
ARCHER: We've brought the Vulcan ambassador to meet with Commander
Shran! <br/>(He ducks quickly again.) <br/>ARCHER: It looks like two of them. One on top of
that structure <br/>(He fires his phase pistol at it.) <br/>ARCHER: And the other on the
ground. <br/>(Archer fires there too.) <br/>ARCHER: If I can work my way around I might be able
to come up from behind them. <br/>(He hands his pistol to Soval.) <br/>
SOVAL: What do you expect me to do with this? <br/>
ARCHER: Make sure they don't see me. <br/>
SOVAL: I haven't fired a weapon in fifty years. <br/>
ARCHER: You don't have to hit anything, just keep them occupied. Really
occupied or I'm not going to get very far. <br/>
(Soval and T'Pol lay down fire as Archer crawls and scuttles to cover
behind the uppermost sniper, then climbs a convenient ladder.) <br/>

Vulcan ships. <br/>

TUCKER: Travis, lay in a new course. I want you to put us right between
them. <br/>

of the second sniper to sneak up behind her. It's Talah.) <br/>

Andorian gun he has confiscated.) <br/>ARCHER: I'm not sure if it's set on stun. <br/>
(Tarah turns slowly towards him.) <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pol, cease fire! <br/>
TARAH: It doesn't have a stun setting. <br/>(She drops her weapon off the
ledge.) <br/>
ARCHER: You fired on my shuttle. You're trying to kill Soval, undermine
everything that Shran is trying to do here. Why? Do you want a war with
the Vulcans? <br/>
TARAH: All we want is a chance to fight for what's ours before cowards
like Shran negotiate it away. <br/>
ARCHER: You can take that up with him. Let's go. <br/>
(Archer trips on an iron ring set in the loose rubble of the ruin, and
Tarah takes the opportunity to fight with him for the gun. He falls
through a hole but still manages to hang on and beat her. Then Shran
and two soldiers turn up) </font></p>

TUCKER: Put 'em both on. <br/>(Vulcan on the left of the viewscreen,
Andorian on the right.) <br/>TUCKER: This is Commander Tucker. <br/>
TELEV [on viewscreen]: Captain Telev of the Imperial Guard. <br/>
MUROC [on viewscreen]: Commander, I strongly recommend you withdraw to
a safe distance. <br/>
TELEV [on viewscreen]: I agree. We wouldn't want your vessel to be
damaged by debris from the Vulcan ships. <br/>
MUROC [on viewscreen]: We will not allow the Andorians to land
additional troops on Paan Mokar. <br/>
TELEV [on viewscreen]: It's called Weytahn and our personnel there have
been attacked. We'll provide whatever support they need. <br/>
MUROC [on viewscreen]: Any vessel attempting to enter orbit will be
fired upon. <br/>
TUCKER: That includes yours, Sub-commander. <br/>
TELEV [on viewscreen]: We appreciate your support, Commander Tucker. <br/>
TUCKER: Don't. I'll open fire on any ship that makes an aggressive
move. Phase-cannons? <br/>
REED: Locked and ready. <br/>
MUROC [on viewscreen]: This is not a Starfleet matter. <br/>
TUCKER: As long as my Captain is stuck in the middle of your war zone,
it is. <br/>
MUROC [on viewscreen]: The Andorians have made it impossible for us to
recover Captain Archer. By now, he's most likely a casualty. <br/>
TUCKER: Don't count him out so fast. We've managed to isolate his
bio-signature. Now, why don't you both give him and Ambassador Soval a
chance to do their jobs before we start a war up here? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TARAH: He was ready to kill me. You saw for
yourself. Apparently, these pinkskins aren't as honourable as you
thought. <br/>
(T'Pol and Soval arrive.) <br/>
ARCHER: Are you all right? I suppose I shot the Ambassador to make my
story more convincing. <br/>
SHRAN: Why would my lieutenant, a loyal member of the Imperial Guard,
lie to me? <br/>
SOVAL: Commander, it seems you're willing to resolve this situation
through peaceful means. Do all your officers feel the same? <br/>
T'POL: Have you considered there might be Andorians who would want a
war with Vulcan? <br/>
TARAH: How long have I served with you? Followed your orders when it
could have meant my life? <br/>
ARCHER: She's not the only one who risked their life. I said I'd bring
Soval to meet you and we damn near got killed getting him here. I came
because you asked me. Because you thought I could be trusted. Check
Soval's wound. Check our shuttle. You'll find Andorian weapons
signatures. <br/>
SHRAN: Is this true? Answer me! <br/>
TARAH: What did you expect me to do? <br/>
SHRAN: Follow my orders! <br/>
TARAH: Orders to do nothing while you betray us? It's not too late to
redeem yourself, to make a stand. <br/>
SHRAN: I intend to. Take her. <br/>
TARAH: There are others who feel this way. You'll see. <br/>

They're heading for the planet. <br/>
TRAVIS: The Andorians are following, sir. <br/>

weapons. <br/>
HOSHI: We're being hailed from the surface. It's the Captain. <br/>
TUCKER: Hold off, Malcolm. Put him through. Captain. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Nice to hear your voice, Trip. <br/>
TUCKER: What's going on down there? Are you okay? <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: T'Pol and I are fine. We're at the Andorian command post.
Ambassador Soval's been injured, but Shran's medics are treating him. <br/>
TUCKER: Did you say Shran's medics? <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: He's just being a good host. The Andorians are allowing
the Vulcan ships to move in and pick up their people. <br/>
TUCKER: Glad you let us know. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Did you run into any problems up there? <br/>
TUCKER: Nothing we couldn't handle. I'll fill you in later. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: We had a pretty rough landing. We'll need a ride back to
the ship. <br/>
TUCKER: I'll send Travis down in Shuttlepod Two. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SHRAN: The Imperial Council will not be satisfied
until Vulcan recognises our claim to Weytahn. <br/>
ARCHER: I believe someone once defined a compromise as a solution that
neither side is happy with. <br/>
SHRAN: In that case, these talks have been extremely successful. <br/>
SOVAL: I consider any negotiation that averts war to be a success. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Shran stands and uncorks a purple bottle.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
SHRAN: Join me in a drink to
celebrate our mutual dissatisfaction. <br/>
SOVAL: Vulcans don't drink. But this occasion merits an exception. <br/>
(All stand and toast.) <br/>
SHRAN: To the cease fire. It wouldn't have been possible without the
help of our human friends. <br/>
SOVAL: And to the successful continuation of these talks on Andoria. <br/>
SHRAN: I trust there'll be more accomplished than just talk. <br/>
T'POL: With your permission, I'll escort Ambassador Soval to the
airlock. <br/>
ARCHER: Of course. <br/>
SOVAL: Captain, your presence here has not been overly meddlesome.
