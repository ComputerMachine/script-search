TUCKER: Well, for one thing, this is a new challenge. It took me a year

Hernandez in half the time. She needs a Chief Engineer who's been out

REED: Still, it's a likely explanation. <br/>
COLLINS: Doctor Phlox was involved in an altercation the last time he
was in San Francisco. <br/>

attacked him was holding a grudge <br/>

both hands, never mind organise a kidnapping. <br/>

T'POL: I need to run further tests. Their boarding party disabled our
antimatter flow regulators. Warp drive should be repaired in six hours.
<br/>
ARCHER: Give our new Chief Engineer a hand. Tell him to dig a little
deeper, see if these Klingons damaged any other systems. <br/>

ARCHER: The Rigelian freighter. Did you get anything out of the black
box? <br/>

base-pair sequences. <br/>
ANTAAK: Familiar? <br/>
(There's a sound by Phlox's feet, and he looks down to see the targ
nuzzling at his shoes.) <br/>
ANTAAK: Boshar! Feeding time is over. Go back! <br/>
(The creature leaves.) <br/>
PHLOX: Do you think it's wise to keep wild animals in here? <br/>
ANTAAK: There are dozens of creatures in your Sickbay. <br/>
PHLOX: I don't let them roam free. <br/>
ANTAAK: I could never keep Boshar locked up. He was my first patient.
He tore his side open when I was a child. I stitched the wound myself. <br/>
PHLOX: I have seen these sequences before. Six months ago, to be
precise. This is Augment DNA. How did modified human genes find their
way into this virus? <br/>
K'VAGH: Is that really such a surprise, Doctor? It took only two human
Augments to commandeer a Bird of Prey and murder its entire crew. The
Empire could not allow an inferior species to gain an advantage on us.
Imagine, every Starfleet vessel manned with genetically engineered
humans. <br/>
PHLOX: Earth banned genetic engineering decades ago. The Augments who
attacked you were relics of another era. <br/>
K'VAGH: The Vulcans told that to the High Council. They weren't very
persuasive. We were simply responding to a threat. <br/>
PHLOX: You were trying to create Klingon Augments. But Soong's
experiments were all killed. Where did you get the genetic material? <br/>
ANTAAK: Several embryos were found in the wreckage of the Bird of Prey.
We used them to re-sequence a number of test subjects. There were some
unanticipated side effects. <br/>
PHLOX: Their cranial ridges started to dissolve. Augment DNA was more
aggressive than you realised. <br/>
ANTAAK: For a time it appeared we were quite successful. Our Augments
might have looked human, but they were Klingon. Stronger, more
intelligent. Then, their neural pathways started to degrade. They died
in agony.
One of the test subjects was suffering from the Levodian flu. The
Augment genes modified the virus. <br/>
PHLOX: It became airborne. You should have told me this earlier! <br/>
K'VAGH: If you hope to ever leave this place, I suggest you stop asking
questions and resume work. </font></p>

HOSHI: What do you think? <br/>
T'POL: We may be able to reconstruct the directory with a recursive
algorithm. <br/>
HOSHI: Is it unusual to have weird dreams after a mind meld? <br/>
T'POL: Subconscious thoughts are often exchanged. They sometimes
surface during sleep. <br/>
HOSHI: I had a bizarre dream last night. Commander Tucker was in it. We
were in a strange place. It was all white. There was almost a romantic
quality to it. I don't ever remember dreaming about Commander Tucker
before. <br/>

ARCHER: You're sure that freighter was destroyed by Orion weapons? <br/>
REED: There's no doubt. <br/>
ARCHER: I asked T'Pol to double-check your analysis. The freighter was
fired on by Klingon disruptors. <br/>

ARCHER: You haven't said much of anything. You've told me a lot about
your father, his years in the Royal Navy. Their tradition of honour and
service. How do you think he'll react when he learns you're facing

PHLOX: I can't sequence these nucleotides any faster. Perhaps you
should've abducted Doctor Soong. He could've mapped this genome more
efficiently than I can. <br/>
ANTAAK: We tried. Soong was under heavy guard. <br/>
K'VAGH: If you don't accelerate your efforts, there will be no one left
to cure. The High Council has dispatched the fleet. They have
annihilated N'Vak Colony. <br/>
ANTAAK: N'Vak was one of the first planets affected by the plague. <br/>
PHLOX: They're massacring the victims? <br/>
K'VAGH: The Council will do whatever's required to contain this
outbreak. <br/>
PHLOX: General, we're making progress, but I'll need a few weeks to
develop an antiviral agent. It will have to be tested. <br/>
K'VAGH: Millions will be infected by then. The Council will not wait! <br/>
ANTAAK: How long until the fleet reaches us? <br/>
K'VAGH: Five days. <br/>
PHLOX: I can't cure this in five days! <br/>
ANTAAK: They wouldn't destroy us if they knew we had created Klingon
Augments. <br/>
K'VAGH: The experiment failed! <br/>
ANTAAK: It succeeded for a brief period. If Phlox and I can find a way
to stabilise the human DNA prior to the onset of stage three, our
Augments would survive. If we're successful, you could use them as
leverage, force the High Council to give us more time to find a cure. <br/>
PHLOX: You don't seriously expect me to help you create Klingon
Augments?! <br/>
K'VAGH: You could save the inhabitants of this planet. <br/>
