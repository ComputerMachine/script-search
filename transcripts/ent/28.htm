[OC]: Last time on Enterprise. <br/>
(The explosion in the atmosphere of the Paraagan mining colony.) <br/>
HOSHI: (in Sickbay) There's nothing left. No buildings, no trees, no
people. <br/>
ARCHER: That's impossible. There were thirty six hundred colonists. <br/>
ARCHER: (Ready room) The mission's been cancelled. <br/>
TUCKER: I can't believe you're letting them do this to us. You've
waited all your life to command this ship. <br/>
DANIELS: (Archers apartment) History never recorded the disaster.
Someone violated the Temporal Accord. Someone who doesn't want your
mission to succeed. <br/>
ARCHER: Are you telling me that Enterprise didn't cause that explosion?
<br/>
ARCHER: (Ready room) He brought me back ten months, but I knew
everything I know now. How is that possible? <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: The Suliban destroyed that colony. (attack on cloaked
cruiser) We're going back to get proof. <br/>
FUTURE MAN: (Temporal chamber) Have your ships bring me Archer. <br/>
T'POL: (Bridge} Captain Archer is no longer aboard Enterprise. <br/>
SILIK [on viewscreen]: I thought he was smarter than this. He could
have saved all your lives. <br/>
REED: It's targeting our warp core. <br/>
DANIELS: (Devastated building) You're in the thirty first century,
Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: If bringing me here caused this, then send me back. I'll take
my chances with Silik. <br/>
DANIELS: You don't understand. The time portals have been destroyed.
Everything's been destroyed. There's no way to send you back. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: And now, the conclusion.</i> </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: He's not on board. You must have sensors
that can confirm that. <br/>
SILIK [on viewscreen]: You've lied to me before. If you don't tell me
where he is I'll have no alternative but to <br/>
T'POL: Come see for yourself, or send your soldiers. You'll realise I'm
telling the truth. <br/>
SILIK [on viewscreen]: Drop out of warp and prepare to be boarded.
<br/>(Ends transmission.) <br/>
REED: Security teams to docking ports one, two, and three. <br/>
T'POL: This is Sub-Commander T'Pol. All security teams remain where you
are. <br/>
TUCKER: Are you crazy? How do we know how many Suliban are coming
aboard? They could try to take over the ship. <br/>
T'POL: There are thirty armed vessels surrounding us. Unless I'm
mistaken their weapons are still targeting our warp core. Mister Reed?
So, unless you have a better suggestion? <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: If this place was destroyed as long ago as
it seems to have been, then what are you doing here? You and your
watchdog buddies don't exactly fit in with all this. <br/>
DANIELS: You're thinking of time travel like we're in some H.G. Wells
novel. We're not. It's far more complicated. There's no way for you to
understand. <br/>
ARCHER: Try me. Listen, I realise your little utopia is gone, and I
sympathise, but if you're telling me the truth, if you've brought me
eight hundred years into the future, into this future, I think I
deserve some answers. <br/>
DANIELS: I don't have any answers. And you're right, I shouldn't be
here. Which means you shouldn't be here either, but you are. We are. We
brought you here to protect the time line. We did quite a job. <br/>
ARCHER: What's wrong? <br/>
DANIELS: It's gone. <br/>
ARCHER: What's gone? <br/>
DANIELS: The monument. It was right here on the same street as the
library. It was obviously never built. <br/>
ARCHER: Why is that a problem? Who did it commemorate? <br/>
DANIELS: Not who. <br/>
ARCHER: Then what? <br/>
DANIELS: An organisation. The Federation. It doesn't exist for you, not
yet. <br/>
ARCHER: But it will? Fine. Keep your missing monument to yourself.
Where's this library you were talking about? <br/>
DANIELS: It should be right down there, if it was ever built, and even
it was, it will be of no help. All the data's stored electronically. <br/>
(They head to an impressive neo-classical building with a low central
dome, triangular portico, tall windows, which looks very intac.t) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Massive bookshelves, librarians ladders, light
streaming through the broken dome skylight.) <br/>
DANIELS: Books made with paper. There aren't supposed to be books here.
<br/>
ARCHER: Well, there are. So, I suggest we use some of them to figure
out what you did to the last thousand years when you brought me here
this morning. </font></p>

SILIK: Is he correct? <br/>
T'POL: Don't you believe your scanners? <br/>
SILIK: Is he correct? <br/>
HOSHI: We didn't have time to make a copy. <br/>
TUCKER: Leave her alone! <br/>
SILIK: Lower your weapon. (does likewise) If we find Captain Archer
aboard this vessel, you'll all be punished for lying to me. <br/>
RAAN: He's not here, unless he's dead, but we did find this. <br/>(He shows
Silik a scanner reading.) <br/>
SILIK: Where? <br/>
RAAN: In that lift. It's an hour old, maybe two. <br/>
SILIK: When I saw him last, your Captain spoke of a Temporal Cold War.
What was he talking about? <br/>
T'POL: Captain Archer believed Crewman Daniels was from the future, but
if I recall, you killed him. <br/>
SILIK: What else? <br/>
T'POL: Nothing else. <br/>
SILIK: There's a temporal signature in your turbolift. What do you know
of that? <br/>
T'POL: The last time we saw Captain Archer, he was entering that
turbolift. <br/>
SILIK: Perhaps you haven't been lying to me. (to Tucker) You, shut down
all comm. systems and computer terminals with the exception of
Engineering and the Bridge. Confine all of them to their quarters. If
anyone resists <br/>
RAAN: Understood. <br/>
(one grabs Trip, he shoves back and weapons are drawn again) <br/>
T'POL: Under the circumstances, it would be best to do what he says,
Commander. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (It's a beautiful sunny morning.) <br/>
SOVAL: They're three days overdue. <br/>
FORREST: I told you, Ambassador. Archer said he was returning with
proof that they weren't responsible for the tragedy on Paraagan Two. <br/>
SOVAL: You also told me Starfleet had ordered him to deliver
Sub-Commander T'Pol and his medical officer to the Vulcan ship D'kyr.
They're three days overdue. <br/>
WILLIAMS: The D'kyr has long range sensors. Have they detected
Enterprise? <br/>
SOVAL: Captain Archer's negligence caused the death of three thousand
colonists. Your superiors instructed them to return to Earth. Their
mission is over. They haven't followed those instructions. <br/>
FORREST: You didn't answer the Commander's question. Has your ship
detected Enterprise? <br/>
SOVAL: The D'kyr said they were joined by a number of other vessels.
They're no longer within sensor range. <br/>
WILLIAMS: What kind of vessels? <br/>
SOVAL: They were at too great a distance to identify. Enterprise has
ignored our hails and defied Starfleet's orders. I have no choice but
to send the D'kyr in pursuit. <br/>
FORREST: Jonathan Archer doesn't report to you. <br/>
SOVAL: No, he doesn't, but Sub-Commander T'Pol does, and since she
would never comply with his present actions I have to conclude that
she's being held against her will. <br/>
WILLIAMS: I know you don't think much of Archer, Ambassador, but he is
not in the habit of kidnapping Vulcans. <br/>
FORREST: Fine. You send your ship. Whatever Archer's up to, I'm sure
he's got a good reason. He knows what he's doing. <br/>
SOVAL: Does he really? <br/>(The Vulcan group leave.) <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> RAAN: Have you cycled through the sub-temporal
harmonics? <br/>
SILIK: He's never failed to respond before. <br/>
RAAN: Perhaps he's angry that we didn't return with Archer. <br/>
SILIK: Archer wasn't on Enterprise. Why isn't he responding? I need
instructions. <br/>
RAAN: He said to destroy Enterprise if we couldn't bring him Archer. We
should tow them out of the nebula and do it now. <br/>
SILIK: That temporal signature, it changes everything. If Archer was
pulled through time, we need new instructions. Where is he? <br/>
RAAN: If he's angry with you, you'll be punished again. We should
destroy Enterprise. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: I haven't found a single reference to this
Federation you talked about. <br/>
DANIELS: I doubt you will. <br/>
ARCHER: Because that monument wasn't there? <br/>
DANIELS: Because you weren't there. <br/>
ARCHER: So I disappear one day and all history changes? <br/>
DANIELS: I've looked through the twenty first and twenty second
centuries. Everything looks right up until the Warp Five programme.
After that, nothing looks right. <br/>
ARCHER: There were a lot of people involved in the Warp Five programme.
<br/>
DANIELS: We didn't bring a lot of people here this morning. We just
brought you. <br/>
ARCHER: (reading a book title) The Romulan Star Empire. What's that? <br/>
DANIELS: Maybe you shouldn't be reading that. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't get it. What could I have done that could have been so
important? <br/>
DANIELS: It wasn't just you, it was events you helped set in motion. <br/>
ARCHER: This timeline, the one you say no longer exists. What can you
tell me about it if my mission had continued? <br/>
DANIELS: It would have led to others. <br/>
ARCHER: And? (silence) Okay, what about this Federation? Was Earth part
of it? Was I part of it? <br/>
DANIELS: Silik wanted you, not the data disks. The people he answered
to were more interested in capturing Jonathan Archer than in blaming
Enterprise for the destruction of the colony. They obviously knew what
role you were going to play in the months or years to come. By taking
you away from the twenty second century I caused exactly what I was
trying to prevent. <br/>
ARCHER: You've lost me. <br/>
DANIELS: The only chance I have of restoring my century is by getting
you back to yours. <br/>
ARCHER: Sounds like you've got a chicken-or-the-egg problem. You said
your time portals are gone. All your technology. There isn't even
electricity here. You going to find a bicycle, turn it into a time
machine? <br/>
DANIELS: Maybe we don't need a time machine. Do you have your
communicator? <br/>
ARCHER: (hands it over) And my scanner. <br/>
DANIELS: May I? The people the Suliban were working for came from about
three hundred years ago. They couldn't travel through time, but they
did develop a way to send back images of themselves, to communicate
through time. <br/>
ARCHER: You can't do that with those. <br/>
DANIELS: No, it's a little bit more complicated, but not much. We
learned how to do it in high school, but we're going to need a few
things that might not be too easy to find. <br/>
ARCHER: What are we waiting for? </font></p>

is impossible. <br/>

patrols, and undoes the magnetic lock. Inside, he retrieves the
database projector from the back of a cupboard and leaves, replacing
the lock, turns and sees two Suliban.) </font></p>

about what will happen to you if you don't answer my questions. Are you
thinking about that Lieutenant Reed? Good. Now tell me what this is.

SILIK: Who told you to destroy it? <br/>
REED: Captain Archer, before he left. He didn't want you to find it. <br/>
SILIK: And why would that be? <br/>
REED: He thought you would use it to contact someone. I don't know who.

was some kind of temporal signature. I need instructions. I don't know

to form) I hear you, but I don't understand. Repeat what you said.
Please, repeat what you said. <br/>

ARCHER: I said, you're an ugly bastard. <br/>(He puts Silik's own gun to his head.)
<br/>ARCHER: You try shape-shifting on me, or pulling one of your chameleon routines
and I promise you, Silik, I'll blow your head off. Has Enterprise left

There's no need to punish me. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SOVAL [on viewscreen]: While your explanation of
how you obtained these disks is somewhat implausible, it's obvious that
Enterprise was not responsible for the destruction of the colony. <br/>
ARCHER: It may see somewhat implausible to you, but <br/>
SOVAL [on viewscreen]: Please allow me to finish, Captain. In less than
a single Earth year you've engaged in armed conflicts with over a dozen
species. You've escalated the conflict between my people and the
Andorians which included the destruction of one of our most sacred
monasteries. You helped eighty nine Suliban escape from detention. You
may claim to be on a mission of exploration. I, however, consider you
reckless and irresponsible. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SOVAL: A danger to the Quadrant. Regardless of the
evidence presented here, I plan to advise the Vulcan High Command not
to change its recommendation to Starfleet. Enterprise should be
recalled. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> FORREST: No one's more pleased than I am that
Enterprise wasn't responsible for the tragedy, but Ambassador Soval's
argument may be valid. Starfleet Command has a difficult decision to
make here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: When I was in my early twenties on a trip
to East Africa I saw a gazelle giving birth. It was truly amazing.
Within minutes the baby was standing up, standing up on its own. A few
more minutes and it was walking and before I knew it, it was running
alongside its mother, moving away with the herd. Humans aren't like
that, Ambassador. We may come from the same planet as those gazelles
but we're pretty much helpless when we're born. It takes us months
before we're able to crawl. Almost a full year before we can walk. Our
deep space mission isn't much different. We're going to stumble, make
mistakes, I'm sure more than a few, before we find our footing. But
we're going to learn from those mistakes. That's what being human is
all about. I'm sorry you can't see that. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Starfleet Headquarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SOVAL: Your analogy is very colourful, Captain,
but I question whether it addresses the consequences of your actions. <br/>
T'POL [on viewscreen]: The concept of learning from one's mistakes
shouldn't be difficult for a Vulcan of your wisdom to understand,
Ambassador. Our ancestors </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: Discovered how to suppress their volatile
emotions only after centuries of savage conflict. You spoke of the
destruction of the monastery. What about the Vulcan listening post that
Captain Archer found there? I would hope that our people have learned
from those events that using a sacred sanctuary to spy on others was a
dishonourable practice, to say the least. I don't wish to contradict
Captain Archer, but learning from one's mistakes is hardly exclusive to
humans. Their mission should be allowed to continue. <br/>
(The Vulcans sweep out of the room at Starfleet, and leave Enterprise's
Bridge as well.) <br/>
FORREST [on viewscreen]: The Command Council will review the evidence
and listen to what's been said here today. I'm sure they'll hear from
the Vulcans as well. I'll let you know as soon as there's a decision.
Good luck, Jonathan. All of you. <br/>(Ends transmission.) </font></p>

ARCHER: I can't be certain, but Crewman Fuller might have seen me
coming in here. <br/>
T'POL: She tends to be discreet. What can I do for you? <br/>
ARCHER: I think you put it over the top. Forrest said none of the
others could believe it when you went to bat for us, not to mention
that little listening-post lecture you gave to Soval. <br/>
T'POL: You spoke to the Admiral? <br/>
ARCHER: He woke me up in the middle of the night. Can you believe that?
<br/>
T'POL: I assume with good news. <br/>
