TUCKER: Chief Engineers log, supplemental. This turned out to be the
perfect spot to test the autopilot upgrades. The gas giant has dozens
of moons. It's like a gravitational jigsaw puzzle. Watch out, Travis.
These modifications are working so well, pretty soon we won't need
pilots anymore. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Shuttlepod one. <br/>
TUCKER: Captain? <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Looks like you're about to have some company, Trip.
Sensors are picking up a small <br/>(Fizzle, crackle.) <br/>
TUCKER: Say again, Captain. I'm picking up a lot of interference. <br/>
ARCHER [OC] There's a small vessel approaching your position. <br/>
(Tucker dashes to the pilot seat to see a small ship heading for him.) <br/>
TUCKER: This is Commander Charles Tucker. <br/>(It fires at him and passes
close overhead, then returns for another strafing run.) <br/>TUCKER: Tucker to
Enterprise. Mayday. I'm losing power. Mayday! If you can hear me, I'm
making an emergency landing, thrusters only. I take it back, Travis. I
could use a flesh and blood pilot right about now. </font></p>

Tucker, do you read me? <br/>
TRAVIS: Malcolm? <br/>
REED: I detected weapons fire and then both ships just disappeared. <br/>
ARCHER: Last known position? <br/>
REED: Approximately fifty thousand kilometres, bearing zero zero
three mark two seven, I think. I can't be more specific. It's the
damned interference. <br/>
T'POL: Many of these moons have atmospheres that contain selenium
isotopes. That's most likely what's affecting our sensors. <br/>
ARCHER: Trip's a good pilot. If he was near one of those moons he most
likely set down on it. How many are there? <br/>
T'POL: Sixty two. <br/>
ARCHER: Then we'd better start looking. Travis. <br/>
TRAVIS: Yes, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: We'll scan every moon, even if we have to do it with
binoculars. Keep hailing him. </font></p>

scene with insects chirping. There's rock and a dead tree. He goes back
inside to tend to his scratches and record events to date.) <br/>
TUCKER: Chief Engineer's Log, supplemental. For the record, I was
attacked by a small craft. I don't know what I did to provoke him.
Something in this moon's atmosphere neutralised my engines. I was
forced to make an emergency landing. Looks like I took some damage on
impact. Main power's still offline. I don't think I'll be flying out of
here. First things first. I'll try and get the transceiver working,

the shrubs and he leaves the transceiver to go and investigate,
carrying a torch and a large metal bar-like tool. Suddenly there's
weapon fire and he falls to the ground. A big alien is shouting
something and shooting at him. Tucker dives into the shuttlepod for cover
and closes the hatch. He looks out towards the campfire to see -) <br/>

ARCHER: Who are they? <br/>
T'POL: An Arkonian military vessel. <br/>
ARCHER: You've dealt with them? <br/>
T'POL: No, but I'm aware of their reputation. If we're in their
territory, we should proceed with extreme caution. <br/>

ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: You
are on an unauthorised course. Leave immediately. <br/>
ARCHER: And you are? <br/>
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: Captain Khata'n Zshaar. I have orders to
destroy any vessel that violates our territory. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm Captain Jonathan Archer of the Starship Enterprise. We
weren't aware that this system was claimed by anyone. <br/>
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: Why is there a Vulcan on your bridge? <br/>
ARCHER: Sub-Commander T-Pol is my Science Officer. <br/>
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: Turn your ship around. <br/>
ARCHER: A member of my crew is missing. We believe he exchanged weapons
fire with a small vessel. Was it one of yours? <br/>
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: We sent a patrol ship to intercept your
shuttle. We have also lost contact. <br/>
ARCHER: Then maybe we can look for them together. Once we've recovered
our crewman we'll be more than happy to leave. <br/>
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: If your shuttle did encounter my patrol ship,
your crewman is already dead. <br/>
ARCHER: Either way, we're not going anywhere until we know what
happened. Now it seems to me we have a similar problem. Two missing
people and sixty two moons. It'll go a lot faster if we use both our
ships to co-ordinate the search. The sooner we get started, the sooner
we'll be out of your territory. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Shuttlepod]</b> </font></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Tucker has gone out scouting for the thief. He
locates another crashed pod and campfire, but makes a noise as his foot
slips on some gravel. The alien hasn't heard him, so Tucker makes his way
back to his own pod to try and continue repairs.)<br/>TUCKER: It's him. I recognise his shuttlecraft. He
seems about as bad off as I am. Whatever knocked out my engines
probably did the same to his. If I'd brought a Universal Translator
along, I'd be able to explain to this guy that I'm just trying to get
out of here like he is. One piece of good news. It's starting to warm
up a little. Dawn is coming. </font></p>

transceiver, and scratching his head.) <br/>
TUCKER [OC]: I'm coming out now. Please don't fire. I want to talk. I'm
unarmed. <br/>
(The alien heads off in the direction of the voice, and Tucker sneaks in
from the opposite side to get his transceiver and do something to it.) <br/>
TUCKER [OC]: We need to talk. You have something that belongs to me. I
want it back. If you understand anything that I'm saying to you, I want
you to listen very, very closely. Mary had a little lamb. Its fleece
was white as snow. <br/>(The alien discovers a PADD and speaker in a tree.)
<br/>TUCKER [OC]: And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go. <br/>(The alien
dashes back to his camp, tripping an alarm on the way so Tucker has time
to hide. He leaves the transceiver behind. The alien comes looking for
him, Tucker knocks the gun out of his hand. They wrestle briefly until
Tucker manages to snatch it up.) <br/>
TUCKER: Now, maybe we can introduce ourselves. <br/>
ZHO'KAAN: (something) <br/>
TUCKER: Nice to meet you, too. Now, I don't want to hurt you. I just
want my transceiver back. <br/>
(The alien says something, then manages to knock Tucker's feet out from
under him, grab the gun and shoot him. Later, the alien is trying to work on the transceiver to no avail. He
goes over to Tucker and kicks him awake.) <br/>
TUCKER: I'm no good until I've had my coffee.<br/>
(The alien hauls him to his feet and gestures towards the equipment,
saying something.)<br/>
TUCKER: You wouldn't have a Universal Translator on you?<br/>
ZHO'KAAN: (shouts) <br/>
TUCKER: I don't understand a word you're saying! <br/>(Zho'Kaan lets go of him and mutters towards the transceiver.)<br/>
TUCKER: I can't make it work. It's broken. You know, broken. I was
trying to make repairs when you stole it.<br/>
(Zho'Kaan implyes that Tucker should mend it then.) <br/>
TUCKER: What?<br/>
ZHO'KAAN: Kushka roatta.<br/>
TUCKER: You want me to fix your transceiver. <br/>(The alien jerks his head.)
<br/>TUCKER: Is that a yes or a no?<br/>
ZHO'KAAN: Kushka. <br/>
TUCKER: Kushka to you, too. <br/>(Zho'Kaan pulls a gun on him,)<br/>
TUCKER: You kill me and I can't fix anything. You're going to have to
untie me. I need my hands. <br/>
ZHO'KAAN: (softly, threateningly)<br/>

unties his wrists.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: Any progress? <br/>
T'POL: We've searched five of the moons. No sign of Commander Tucker or
the Arkonian ship. <br/>
ARCHER: And the Arkonians? <br/>
T'POL: It appears they've made no progress either. They're continuing
to search the moons they agreed to. <br/>
ARCHER: This is their territory. They could have called for more ships
to help search. <br/>
T'POL: I'm afraid they don't trust us. Primarily because I'm a Vulcan. <br/>
ARCHER: What's the bad blood? <br/>
T'POL: We made First Contact nearly a hundred years ago, not long after
the Arkonians developed warp drive. But from the beginning, our
relations were difficult. Your people accepted Vulcan guidance, opened
diplomatic and cultural exchanges. The Arkonians were suspicious and
deceitful. Eventually, the High Command withdrew its contingent. <br/>
ARCHER: Well, maybe we'll have better luck with them. <br/>
T'POL: It doesn't appear promising. <br/>
ARCHER: They agreed to work with us. <br/>
T'POL: For now. I'd advise you to remain cautious. Arkonians are
unpredictable. They're prone to hostility. <br/>
T'POL: I'll keep that in mind. Let me know when we reach the next moon.

He pulls at a wire and falls, cutting himself.) <br/>

ZHO'KAAN: Drat. Drat komacha. <br/>(He gestures Trip to get back to work.) <br/>
TUCKER: All right, all right. I can't fix this thing. It's a lost
cause. Maybe if you vomit on it, it'll fix itself. Come over here. I
want you to see this. Here. Come here. It's like talking to Porthos.
See this? I tried bypassing the induction coil, but it didn't work.
See? In here. <br/>(As Zho'Kaan leans over, Trip pulls out a tube and
something sprays into the alien's face, sending him reeling in pain.
Tucker gets the weapon.) <br/>TUCKER: I can't fix this. I need to get back to my ship.

it away again.) <br/>TUCKER: We can fight some more if you want, or we can try to get

out the isotopes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: We'll talk to them, but I won't let you
stay down there much longer. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TUCKER: Understood. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Archer out. <br/>
(A little later, and sweat is visibly pouring off Tucker. Why isn't it
evaporating?) <br/>
TUCKER: Tucker to Enterprise. Enterprise, respond. Some of these relays
have fused. Must be the heat. Hey. Gan tak. <br/>(He pours some water on
Zho'Kaan to wake him, then takes a drink.) <br/>TUCKER: I don't suppose the
Captain'll trust me to go out on my own for a while. I wouldn't be
surprised if he knocked me down to steward. Your orange juice, sir. Jam
or marmalade, sir? But I tell you I wouldn't trade my time on
Enterprise. Not for anything. I've seen things I could never imagine
back home. I saw the Great Plume of Agosoria and I saw the ringed moons
of Matalas Prime. And I stood on an asteroid crater twice as high as
Everest, and went diving in the ice caves of Etheenia. Rode in a
Suliban cell ship. Spent the night, I spent the night with a princess.
Oh, and I even got pregnant once. Now there's a story. I'm sure you
have stories, too. That's why we chose this life, right? See things
we've never seen before. Hell of a ride, though. Hell of a ride. <br/>(Then he sees
something in the glare.) <br/>TUCKER: Zho'Kaan. V'dhoze. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: Come in. <br/>(T'Pol and Zshaar enter.) <br/>ARCHER: I just
got a report from my doctor. Your pilot's responding well. He'll be
ready to go home in a few hours. <br/>
ZSHAAR: And your crewman? <br/>
ARCHER: He's tired and a bit sunburned, but he's doing fine. <br/>
ZSHAAR: If I discover that my pilot fired on your shuttle without
provocation, he'll be disciplined. <br/>
ARCHER: It was a misunderstanding. I hope we can avoid them in the
future. <br/>
ZSHAAR: I expect you to leave this system immediately, as agreed.
<br/>(Zshaar leaves.) <br/>
ARCHER: I guess we won't be adding the Arkonians to our list of
friends. <br/>
T'POL: The encounter was less volatile than I expected. You managed to
establish better relations in a single day than the Vulcans have in a
century. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's hope it stays that way. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TUCKER: How's he doing? <br/>
PHLOX: Why don't you ask him yourself? The Universal Translator is
online. <br/>
TUCKER: They told me another ten minutes of sunshine, and we'd have
been cooked. <br/>
ZHO'KAAN: Tarattaash. <br/>
TUCKER: I thought you said the UT was working. <br/>
ZHO'KAAN: I believe you promised me some Tarattaash. <br/>(Zho'Kaan makes the universal drinking gesture.)
<br/>
TUCKER: You mean the brown stuff you were drinking? Won't take a
minute. Anything else while I'm at it? Our chef is making something
called chicken Marsala tonight. <br/>
ZHO'KAAN: Tarat <br/>
TUCKER: Tarattaash. Got you. <br/>
ZHO'KAAN: Trip. When I fired at your vessel. I'm grateful I didn't
destroy it. <br/>
TUCKER: That makes two of us.</font> </p>
