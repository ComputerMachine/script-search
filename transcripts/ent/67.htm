It had to do with who the Major thinks is more capable of carrying out
this rescue. <br/>

He likes to keep to himself. This feel okay? <br/>

TUCKER: But, you spend enough time around him, you come to realise
there's no one you'd rather have watching your back. <br/>

TUCKER: Posture? Sure. Take a seat. <br/>
COLE: I just get the feeling whenever Lieutenant Reed looks at one of
us, he sees the enemy. <br/>

maybe. Relax. <br/>

TUCKER: This is one of the first pressure points T'Pol worked on.
Helped me get through many a night. <br/>
COLE: Feels great. Too bad this can't be a part of our training
routine. <br/>
TUCKER: You should bring it up with Hayes. <br/>
COLE: His training regimen hasn't changed since I joined up. Major
Hayes likes consistency. <br/>
TUCKER: So does Malcolm. He told me that while he was in Starfleet
training, he ate the exact same three meals every day for a year. <br/>
COLE: They're definitely cut from the same cloth. <br/>
TUCKER: Maybe that's why they get along so well. (pressing harder)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: Come in. <br/>
REED: You wanted to see me, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: I had a conversation with Major Hayes this morning. He wants to
put your security team and all the senior officers through a series of
training drills. <br/>
REED: We run drills twice a week. Senior officers are free to attend. <br/>
ARCHER: These would be different. They'd be conducted by Major Hayes
and the MACOs. <br/>
REED: Sir? <br/>
ARCHER: We're heading into a hostile situation. We don't know what
we're going to face when we get there. <br/>
REED: My people are ready, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: The MACOs' tactics and technology are two, three years beyond
Starfleet's. Why not let them pass on some of that expertise? You don't
agree. <br/>
REED: The MACOs' expertise comes from simulated combat, all conducted
on Earth. On the other hand, we've fought numerous alien species on
many different worlds. If anything, we should be giving the MACOs the
benefit of our experience. <br/>
ARCHER: Hayes and his men have gone up against a few aliens on this
mission, including the Xindi. They've handled themselves pretty well.
I'd like you to co-ordinate the training sessions with the Major. <br/>
REED: Aye, sir. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: Ah, I appreciate your stopping by so
quickly. <br/>
T'POL: What did you want to ask me. <br/>
PHLOX: Are you acquainted with Corporal Amanda Cole? <br/>
T'POL: She's one of the MACOs. <br/>
PHLOX: She was in this morning with a mild headache. Says she's been
experiencing it for a week now. Every test I ran came back negative.
Frankly, I was mystified until she mentioned she was receiving Vulcan
neuro-pressure from Commander Tucker. <br/>
T'POL: You believe it's causing her headaches? <br/>
PHLOX: Well, I wanted to ask you. Neuro-pressure's a highly specialised
discipline. Commander Tucker's only be receiving it for a couple of
months. I thought it was possible that he might have misapplied one of
it's techniques. <br/>
T'POL: It's possible. <br/>
PHLOX: Well, I've already spoken to Corporal Cole about using caution,
but I was wondering if you might have a word with Commander Tucker.
Perhaps during your next session with him? <br/>
T'POL: Gladly. <br/>
PHLOX: Everything all right? <br/>
T'POL: Yes. If there's nothing else. <br/>
PHLOX: Oh, there is one other thing. If you find time, perhaps you
could schedule a neuro-pressure session with Corporal Cole. Maybe undo
some of Commander Tucker's work. </font></p>

oh eight hundred sound. <br/>
REED: I prefer to train in the evenings. <br/>
HAYES: Any reason? <br/>
REED: You get a better workout. Muscles are looser, reaction times
quicker. <br/>
HAYES: How about Tuesdays and Fridays in the morning, Wednesdays in the
evening. <br/>
REED: How about Tuesdays and Fridays in the evenings, and Wednesday in
the morning. <br/>
HAYES: You're not making this very easy. <br/>
REED: I'm not trying to make it difficult. <br/>
HAYES: With all due respect, I think that's exactly what you're trying
to do. <br/>
REED: With all due respect? Is that what you call circumventing my
authority? <br/>
HAYES: I wasn't aware I'd done that. <br/>
REED: And what did you think you were doing when you went to the
Captain with this proposal? <br/>
HAYES: If I'd come to you first you'd have turned me down flat. <br/>
REED: You're probably right, but the decision was mine to make. <br/>
HAYES: I didn't mean to deprive you of the opportunity. <br/>
REED: I think that's exactly what you meant to do. <br/>
HAYES: Whatever you might think, sir, my only concern is the successful
outcome of this mission. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: What's the problem. <br/>
TRAVIS: I can't understand it, Captain. It's like the stars keep
shifting positions. <br/>
ARCHER: What do you mean? <br/>
TRAVIS: There, they just did it again. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe it's one of the navigational sensors. <br/>
TRAVIS: I've already run two diagnostics. I can't find anything wrong. <br/>
T'POL: I think I have the cause. An unusually strong gravimetric
disturbance approximately three light years away. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's go take a look. <br/>
(They arrive at an orangey brown bubbly gloop anomaly.) <br/>
T'POL: It appears to be a convergence of spatial anomalies. <br/>
REED: It's more than seven hundred million kilometres in diameter. <br/>
HOSHI: Captain, I'm picking up an intermittent signal. Very faint. <br/>
T'POL: An object, approximately five metres in length. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's see it. <br/>
(There in the gloop is an escape pod or something similar.) <br/>
T'POL: It's just a few hundred metres from the edge. I'm reading one
biosign. Humanoid. <br/>
REED: Could be an escape pod. <br/>
ARCHER: Are there any other ships in the vicinity? <br/>
T'POL: None. The biosigns are very erratic. <br/>
ARCHER: Bring the grappler online. <br/>
(It misses because the gloop slows and deflects it.) <br/>
ARCHER: Try again. <br/>
REED: I'll see if I can compensate. <br/>
(It gets the pod, but orange whatever surges out and over the hull.) <br/>
ARCHER: Travis. <br/>
(The air goes purple and the Bridge fills with sparkly things and gas.
Consoles go bang.) <br/>
REED: We're losing systems all over the ship. <br/>
TRAVIS: Helm's not responding. <br/>

ARCHER: Do you think you can stop it? <br/>
PHLOX: I don't know yet. I've managed to revive him, but he's in a fair
amount of pain. <br/>
ARCHER: (goes to the biobed) I'm Captain Archer. <br/>
ALIEN: You had no right to bring me here. <br/>
PHLOX: We were trying to save your life. <br/>
ALIEN: I didn't ask for your help. Return me to my ship. <br/>
ARCHER: Your vessel has minimal life support. You wouldn't last too
long if we took you back. <br/>
ALIEN: That's none of your concern. <br/>

the gravimetric waves. <br/>
ARCHER: Get us underway as soon as you can. <br/>
TRAVIS: Just need a day to upload and test these corrections. <br/>
(Travis leaves.)<br/>
ARCHER: Learn anything? <br/>
T'POL: A great deal. The disturbance appears to be expanding at a rate
of several kilometres per second, and it's location is exactly
equidistant to five of the Spheres. <br/>
ARCHER: Do you think the Spheres have something to do with creating
this thing? <br/>
T'POL: It's possible. This planet was once an inhabited world. It was
engulfed some time ago. I couldn't find any signs of life. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe the alien we picked up is the last survivor. <br/>
T'POL: A possibility. <br/>
ARCHER: I want you and Trip to take a look at the pod. If we can't
revive the alien, it may be our best source of information. </font></p>

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HAYES: We incorporate elements from numerous
disciplines. It's extremely effective in hand to hand situations. What
I'd like to do now is break up into sparring pairs, run through some of
the moves you just saw. Let's get started. <br/>
(Tucker pairs up with Cole, the other senior staff with other MACOs,
T'Pol is watching Tucker get his bottom slapped when she gets floored

REED: That's all for today. <br/>
HAYES: We still have the shoulder throws to cover. <br/>

HAYES: That was a sparring demonstration. <br/>
REED: It was way out of line. That last throw was completely
unnecessary. <br/>

REED: Fair game. <br/>
HAYES: It's just a little blood, sir. No one got hurt. <br/>

pin-point the frequency. <br/>
T'POL: Doctor Phlox has asked me to speak with you. <br/>
TUCKER: What about? <br/>
T'POL: Corporal Cole's been experiencing headaches. The Doctor believes
they might be caused by your neuro-pressure sessions. <br/>
TUCKER: She never said anything about headaches. <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps she didn't want to worry you. <br/>
TUCKER: Why would neuro-pressure be the cause? <br/>
T'POL: It shouldn't be performed by novices. If misapplied, you could
cause nerve damage. <br/>
TUCKER: I've performed it on you plenty of times. <br/>
T'POL: Under my supervision. <br/>
TUCKER: I see. You want to supervise me and Corporal Cole? <br/>
T'POL: I think it would simply be best if you ended the sessions. These
electrodes were collecting biometric data from the occupant. <br/>
TUCKER: Amanda won't be too happy about ending the sessions. <br/>
T'POL: I'm sure she won't. <br/>
TUCKER: What do you mean by that? <br/>
T'POL: I've noticed that you and Corporal Cole have become somewhat
friendly. <br/>
TUCKER: Friendly. <br/>
T'POL: Last week you were eating together in the mess hall, and in the
training session yesterday she touched your behind. <br/>
TUCKER: You've been keeping a pretty close eye on us. <br/>
T'POL: You're hard to miss. <br/>
TUCKER: Look, Amanda and I just share a lot of interests, that's all.
We both come from Florida <br/>
T'POL: There's no reason to justify your behaviour. I was simply
suggesting you might use some discretion. <br/>
TUCKER: Discretion. <br/>
T'POL: It's not appropriate for a senior officer to fraternise with a
subordinate. <br/>
TUCKER: She's not Starfleet. There's nothing inappropriate about it.
What's wrong? <br/>
T'POL: We need to get this data to the Captain immediately. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ready room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: There's no mistake. The pod's hull contains
the exact combination of alloys we found on the surface of the Spheres.
<br/>
ARCHER: You remember the Triannon creation myth? <br/>
T'POL: They believed the Spheres were created by divine beings who will
one day return to the Chosen Realm. <br/>
ARCHER: And that the Spheres were reshaping the Expanse into a paradise
for the faithful. <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps Triannon mythology has a basis in fact. It appears the
pod was designed to transmit data regarding the alien's physiological
status. I believe he was inserted into the disturbance so someone could
monitor his exposure to the environment. <br/>
ARCHER: A canary. On Earth, miners used to take canaries into the
tunnels with them. If the canary didn't die, the miners knew the air
would be safe to breathe, and they could proceed. </font></p>

TUCKER: Okay. <br/>
REED: So, why don't you tell me about you and Miss Cole? <br/>
TUCKER: We're friends. Is everyone on this ship watching us? <br/>
REED: You're pretty hard to miss. <br/>
TUCKER: That's what T'Pol said. <br/>
REED: Is it true she's giving Amanda neuro-pressure now? <br/>
TUCKER: So? <br/>
REED: I heard it was damage control from your tender touch. <br/>
TUCKER: T'Pol's just smoothing out some of the rough spots. That's all.
<br/>
REED: And why were you giving Amanda Cole neuro-pressure anyway? <br/>
TUCKER: What's it to you? <br/>
REED: Well, from what I'm told, it's a pretty intimate procedure, for
just friends. <br/>
TUCKER: I do it with T'Pol. Are you implying there's something going on
there as well? <br/>
REED: That's the rumour. <br/>
TUCKER: Look, for the last time, there's nothing going on with any of
us, between any of us. <br/>
REED: Right. You're all just friends. <br/>
TUCKER: That's right. <br/>
REED: I guess this Vulcan neuro-pressure isn't that intimate after all.
<br/>
TUCKER: Exactly. <br/>

test subject. The region of space where we found you. What is it? <br/>
PHLOX: His pain medication's wearing off. <br/>
ARCHER: Hold off a second. <br/>
PHLOX: Captain. <br/>
ALIEN: I was sent against my will. I am not from your part of space. I
come from a trans-dimensional realm. <br/>
ARCHER: Keep going. <br/>
ALIEN: I don't know why I was sent here. <br/>
ARCHER: I find that hard to believe. <br/>
ALIEN: It's the truth. I was a prisoner. Because of my transgressions,
I've spent my entire adult life inside a cell. One day the guards
offered me freedom if I would participate in an experiment. I agreed.
That's all I remember before I woke up here. <br/>
ARCHER: We found you drifting in a pod, hooked up to banks of
monitoring equipment. You're telling me you have no idea why? <br/>
ALIEN: The experiment was important to them. They wouldn't abandon me.
Take me back. <br/>
ARCHER: That's impossible. <br/>

reappears) What's happening to me? What's happening to me? </font></p>

TUCKER: You aren't saying much tonight. Don't tell me you're still
upset about me and Amanda. <br/>
T'POL: I'm not upset. <br/>
TUCKER: It sure sounds like it. <br/>
T'POL: You're mistaken. <br/>
TUCKER: Why would a few neuro-pressure sessions between me and a MACO
be such a big deal? Unless. <br/>
T'POL: Unless what? <br/>
TUCKER: Unless you're a little jealous. <br/>
T'POL: I don't experience jealousy. <br/>
TUCKER: You're doing a pretty fair imitation of it. <br/>
T'POL: I am not, in any way, jealous of you and Corporal Cole. <br/>
TUCKER: You know, your voice is tensing up. It's a dead giveaway. <br/>
T'POL: I didn't know you were an expert in vocal inflections. <br/>
TUCKER: I don't need to be an expert to read you. Come on, admit it.
You're a little jealous. <br/>
T'POL: You're implying that I'm attracted to you. <br/>
TUCKER: That kind of goes along with the assumption, doesn't it? <br/>
T'POL: I think you're mistaken about who's attracted to whom. <br/>
TUCKER: Are you saying I'm attracted to you? <br/>
T'POL: I don't need to say it. You already have. <br/>
TUCKER: I don't remember that conversation. <br/>
T'POL: It wasn't you, it was your clone. Sim told me. <br/>
TUCKER: Sim? <br/>
T'POL: He said he had feelings for me. <br/>
TUCKER: He told you that. <br/>
T'POL: Standing right there. <br/>
TUCKER: What the hell was he doing in your room? <br/>
T'POL: Your voice is tensing up. <br/>
TUCKER: Oh, now you're the vocal expert. <br/>
T'POL: I don't need to be an expert to read you. <br/>
TUCKER: I can't believe this. I'm jealous of myself? <br/>
T'POL: You're jealous? <br/>
TUCKER: No, absolutely not. Okay, maybe. Maybe I am, a little. <br/>
T'POL: Which would mean you're attracted to me. It goes with the
assumption. <br/>

you're up for it. <br/>

regressed to the level of five year olds. <br/>
