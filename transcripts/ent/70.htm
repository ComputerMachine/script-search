ARCHER: One quarter impulse. <br/>
T'POL:: There appears to be considerable activity around two of the
inner planets. Numerous ships, all Xindi. <br/>
REED: I'm picking up a large array of satellites. They're generating a
detection grid. <br/>
ARCHER: Degra mentioned a security net. <br/>
REED: Seems like we've come to the right place. <br/>
ARCHER: The planetoid we passed on the way in, put us on the other side
of it. <br/>
TRAVIS: Aye, sir. <br/>
T'POL: A convoy of ships is approaching the detection grid. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's see them. <br/>(A mixture of Reptilian and Humanoid designs.)
<br/>ARCHER: Magnify the lead ship. Show me the warp signature. Degra. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Drinks are being poured.) <br/>
DEGRA: It may seem odd to celebrate the completion of a weapon,
particularly one designed to destroy an entire planet, but recall the
words of Enarchis written some fifty years into the Great Diaspora.
Without a world of our own we are but children lost in the wilderness.
One day we'll emerge from this wilderness, and our work here will
ensure that we'll never be lost again. To a new era for all Xindi.

DEGRA: Welcome. <br/>
REPTILIAN: When can we get underway? <br/>
DEGRA: Momentarily. Patience. <br/>
REPTILIAN: Patience is for the dead. <br/>
ARBOREAL: You've accomplished a great deal in a very short time. <br/>
HUMANOID: We owe you our gratitude. <br/>

gratitude for when the humans have been annihilated. </font></p>

can't find a single weakness. <br/>
T'POL: The grid is extremely sensitive. We'd be detected the instant we
passed through. <br/>
TUCKER: We could try disabling it. <br/>
T'POL: It utilises thousands of satellites. If one of them goes out of
commission, it fills the gap. <br/>
ARCHER: What about the insectoid shuttle? <br/>
REED: Make like one of the locals? <br/>
ARCHER: We could fly in, try to locate where the weapon's being
completed. <br/>
T'POL: Their shuttle might be able to get through the grid without
raising suspicion. <br/>
TRAVIS: Captain, we're not exactly experts at piloting that thing. <br/>
TUCKER: It's going to take at least a couple of hours to get up to
speed. <br/>

TUCKER: Great, but unless we plan to fly in ass first we'd better
figure out how to make it go forward. <br/>
TRAVIS: Can't argue with that. <br/>
TUCKER: Let's cycle through these console settings again. Try the port
actuator. <br/>

translation matrix. <br/>
HOSHI: If Commander Tucker wants to speak insectoid I have to get this
right first. <br/>(She plays a sequence of clicks and hisses.) <br/>HOSHI: Believe it or
not, that was have a nice day, or it's equivalent. </font></p>

it and get out. Remember, whatever information you gather won't do us
any good unless you bring it back. <br/>
TUCKER: We'll keep that in mind. <br/>
ARCHER: Good luck. <br/>
TUCKER: Thank you, sir. <br/>
TRAVIS: Thanks, Captain. <br/>

TRAVIS: Doesn't exactly sound like welcome to the neighbourhood. <br/>
TUCKER: Hoshi, don't fail us now. <br/>
XINDI [OC]: Your presence inside the detection grid is unauthorised.
Explain. <br/>
TUCKER: We had a slight navigational malfunction that threw us off
course. It's been corrected. <br/>
XINDI [OC]: Rendezvous with your carrier ship immediately. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: The detection grid is creating too much
interference. I've lost them. <br/>
REED: We're being scanned. <br/>
ARCHER: Where's it coming from? <br/>
REED: I'm not picking up any vessels in the vicinity. <br/>
T'POL: From the moon's surface. A small monitoring station. The moon's
rotation brought it into scanning range. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's see it. Malcolm. <br/>
T'POL: I'm reading three Xindi biosigns. <br/>
ARCHER: Have they sent out a transmission? <br/>
T'POL: Not yet. <br/>
REED: What are they waiting for? <br/>
T'POL: Probably for the moon's rotation to bring them back into

but not enough to indicate a large-scale weapon. <br/>
TRAVIS: There's not much land down there. <br/>
TUCKER: And what land there is doesn't have any life on it. Take us
down, Travis, closer to the surface. Adjust twenty degrees starboard. <br/>
TRAVIS: See something? <br/>
TUCKER: I think so. <br/>(A dark mass in the water.) <br/>
TRAVIS: You did say that most of this thing's power was routed to
structural integrity. <br/>
TUCKER: And you said we could probably fly it inside a gas giant. Hell,
it's only water. <br/>(They dive in.) <br/>
TRAVIS: Structural integrity's holding. <br/>
TUCKER: Take us deeper. Negative z axis ten degrees. <br/>
(they fly down a canyon to see something round, and huge, with lots of
ships around it) <br/>
TRAVIS: Are you getting those scans, sir? <br/>
TUCKER: There's a lot of activity on the right lower hemisphere. I want
to have a look inside. <br/>
TRAVIS: The Captain said get in and get out. <br/>
TUCKER: That's exactly what we're going to do. <br/>

TUCKER: It's definitely in the final phases of construction. Most of
the work that's going on seems maintenance related. <br/>
REED: I've gone over the scans you brought back. That's the explosive
matrix. If we can get close enough we can set off a chain reaction that
will blow this thing to high heaven. <br/>
T'POL: The initial explosion would need to be of considerable yield. <br/>
REED: A couple of photonic torpedoes should do the trick. <br/>
TUCKER: There's room in the shuttle. <br/>
ARCHER: We're talking about a one-way trip. <br/>
TRAVIS: I should be the one to go. <br/>
ARCHER: Forget it. <br/>
TRAVIS: I'm the only one who can pilot that shuttle. <br/>
TUCKER: I practiced on those controls. I can get her in. <br/>
TRAVIS: But I've actually done it. <br/>
TUCKER: Captain, you want a senior officer on this, don't you? <br/>
ARCHER: I'll be flying the mission. <br/>
TUCKER: Captain? <br/>
ARCHER: How soon can you get it ready? <br/>
TUCKER: A couple of hours to get the torpedoes in place. <br/>
ARCHER: Get started. Meet me in the Launch Bay in thirty minutes. I'm
going to need some flying lessons. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DANIELS: Welcome aboard, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: Daniels. Where am I? <br/>
DANIELS: You're on Enterprise. Enterprise J to be exact, a distant
relative of your ship. We're four hundred years in the future. <br/>
(There's a battle going on outside in a murky purple haze.) <br/>
ARCHER: I'm going to assume you brought me here for a good reason. <br/>
DANIELS: Look out there. It extends fifty thousand light years in all
directions, and it is growing. <br/>
ARCHER: I've seen it before. <br/>
DANIELS: I know, in the Expanse. <br/>
ARCHER: You know about the alien we found, the test subject? <br/>
DANIELS: He belongs to the same race that built the Spheres. They're
altering this space to make it habitable for their species. It's a
prelude to invasion. <br/>
ARCHER: We came to the same conclusion. <br/>
DANIELS: It's getting harder and harder to surprise you, Captain. (the
ship shakes from an impact) I've brought you to a monumental moment in
history, the battle of Procyon Five, where the Federation engaged the
Sphere Builders. <br/>
ARCHER: The Federation? You've mentioned them before. <br/>
DANIELS: Vulcans, Andorians, Ithenites, Klingons. Dozens of species,
including humans, all unified in a powerful alliance. Sphere Builders.
<br/>(The large ship is blown to smithereens.) <br/>DANIELS: The Federation wins the
battle, they drive the enemy back into their trans-dimensional realm.
If the Federation had lost, the Sphere Builders would have spread
throughout the galaxy. They would have wiped out everything. This
species has technology which allows them to examine alternate
timelines. They've seen this future and they want to change the
outcome, so they contacted the Xindi and convinced them that humanity
was a dangerous threat. <br/>
ARCHER: They want the Xindi to destroy us. <br/>
DANIELS: Without humanity, the Federation will never exist. You have to
make the Xindi understand that humanity isn't the enemy. In fact, it's
humanity that will protect them from the Sphere Builders when this
battle is won. Contact them. Make peace. <br/>
ARCHER: They're about to deploy their weapon. <br/>
DANIELS: I know. <br/>
ARCHER: I can't let that happen. <br/>
DANIELS: If you destroy their weapon they will only build another. You
are the only one who can convince them of what I have told you. It is
crucial to history that you do not sacrifice yourself. <br/>
ARCHER: My concern is with preventing the deaths of billions of people.
If that's a problem for history, then history will have to suffer. <br/>
DANIELS: Send someone else. <br/>
ARCHER: I won't do that! <br/>
DANIELS: Captain, you have to believe me. You are making a catastrophic
mistake. <br/>
ARCHER: You've made your share of mistakes. <br/>
DANIELS: This isn't one of them. <br/>
ARCHER: Send me back. Send me back now! <br/>
DANIELS: Take this. <br/>(A coin-sized disc.) <br/>DANIELS: It's Xindi. A family medal that
belongs to one of the crewmen on this ship. There are Xindi serving
aboard Enterprise J. <br/>
ARCHER: Why are you giving this to me? <br/>
DANIELS: In case you change your mind. <br/>
ARCHER: I won't. </font></p>

ARCHER: I'm going ahead with the mission. You don't think I should. <br/>
T'POL: He said you're the only one who can end the conflict with the
Xindi. You can't do that if you're dead. <br/>
ARCHER: That's if you accept Daniels' version of the future. <br/>
T'POL: He's in a position to know. <br/>
ARCHER: I thought you were the sceptical one when it came to time
travel. <br/>
T'POL: Our recent visit to Detroit has tempered my scepticism. You
should reconsider your decision. <br/>
ARCHER: What am I supposed to do? Fly a shuttle into the system and
knock on the door, tell the Xindi we want to talk? The weapon is too
close to being launched. If the situation were different maybe I'd
consider it, but I can't. <br/>

DEGRA: We'll have to generate an extremely large vortex to accommodate
that many vessels. <br/>
REPTILIAN: Even after Earth is destroyed, there will be residual
presence in the system. I intend to hunt down and eradicate every
refugee caravan, every colony, every last outpost they have. <br/>
DEGRA: A vortex of that size will be very unstable. You could lose one
or more vessels. <br/>

bargaining with the sun. You make no progress, and you come away
burned. <br/>
DEGRA: It's not him. <br/>
ARBOREAL: The last time I saw you like this was when you delivered the
first weapon. <br/>
DEGRA: That one only killed seven million. This one will destroy an
entire world. <br/>
ARBOREAL: Better their world than ours. <br/>
DEGRA: That's what I keep telling myself, but the reality is that a
good number of the dead will be innocents, and children. <br/>
ARBOREAL It's best not to think about it. <br/>
DEGRA: It's difficult when you have children of your own. <br/>

was ruled by reptiles. <br/>
REPTILIAN: I wasn't aware of that. <br/>
ARCHER: A comet hit, around sixty five million years ago, caused a mass
extinction. Most of the reptiles died out. Mammals became the dominant
species. <br/>
REPTILIAN: How unfortunate. <br/>
ARCHER: Still, the reptiles might have come out on top if it hadn't
been for a slight disadvantage. <br/>
REPTILIAN: And what was that? <br/>
ARCHER: They had brains the size of a walnut. That's very small.
Apparently it's a constant in the universe. <br/>
REPTILIAN: (trying very hard not to throttle him there and then) Earth
vessels. How many? <br/>
ARCHER: The reptiles didn't all die out. Some evolved into snakes,
alligators, turtles. As a matter of fact one of my favourite
restaurants in San Francisco makes the most wonderful turtle soup. You
should try it sometime if you're ever in the area. <br/>
REPTILIAN: You want me to kill you? <br/>
ARCHER: I'm just making conversation. Relaying a few interesting facts
about the world you're trying to destroy. <br/>

exactly where your ship is. <br/>

REPTILIAN: When we lost contact with our lunar outpost, we scanned the
vicinity and discovered it hiding. Unless you tell me exactly what I
want to know I'll dispatch a squadron right now. No more conversation?
I hope you had a chance to say goodbye to your crew. <br/>
ARCHER: All right, but I'll only talk to Degra. <br/>
REPTILIAN: Degra? <br/>
ARCHER: Alone. <br/>
REPTILIAN: I don't know who that is. <br/>
ARCHER: He's building your weapon. Ring a bell now? <br/>
REPTILIAN: What makes you think Degra would be interested in talking to
you? <br/>
ARCHER: Just tell him the name of his third child, Trenia. <br/>
REPTILIAN: Degra has only two children. <br/>
ARCHER: Prove me wrong. Tell him. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: Sensors would have easily detected an
explosion of that magnitude, even underwater. <br/>
TUCKER: I say we go in. Get as close as we can and try to take out the
weapon. <br/>
REED: Agreed. <br/>
T'POL: This system is heavily guarded. Our chances for reaching the
weapon are non-existent. <br/>
TUCKER: We can't just sit here. <br/>
REED: What do you propose we do? <br/>
T'POL: There's still a chance the Captain may succeed. <br/>
REED: The longer we wait here, the greater the likelihood we'll be
spotted. <br/>
T'POL: If we don't hear from the Captain in one hour, I'll pilot a
shuttlepod into the system. <br/>
TUCKER: And do what? <br/>
T'POL: Attempt a diplomatic solution. <br/>
TUCKER: You've got to be kidding. <br/>
REED: You can't possibly believe that has any chance of success. <br/>
T'POL: The odds aren't promising, but the fact that I'm Vulcan may help
me establish a dialogue. <br/>
REED: You'll just be captured or killed. <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps, but at the moment I don't see an alternate course of
action. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: Hello again. <br/>
DEGRA: How do you know me? <br/>
ARCHER: Long story. <br/>
DEGRA: Repeat what you told him. <br/>
ARCHER: The name of your third child is Trenia. <br/>
DEGRA: Leave me alone with him, and take him as well. (reptilians all
leave) <br/>
ARCHER: Three months into the pregnancy your wife contracted Anaprolean
fever. You lost the child. You were going to name it Trenia. <br/>
DEGRA: I've never told that to anyone. <br/>
ARCHER: You told it to me. You also talked about the weapon you
designed, the one that killed seven million people. When you watched
the telemetry come in you wondered how many of those seven million were
children. <br/>
DEGRA: Who are you? <br/>
ARCHER: It doesn't matter who I am or how I know all this. What's
important is that you listen to what I have to say. <br/>
DEGRA: Continue. <br/>
ARCHER: Your reason for building this weapon is based on a lie. <br/>
DEGRA: What lie would that be? <br/>
ARCHER: That at some point in the future humans are going to destroy
your species. <br/>
DEGRA: That is not a lie! <br/>
ARCHER: You know about the Spheres. <br/>
DEGRA: Of course. <br/>
ARCHER: They were constructed by trans-dimensional beings. Their
purpose is to reconfigure the Expanse to make it habitable for their
species. That's what destroys the Xindi, not humanity. <br/>
DEGRA: I've studied the Spheres. There is no evidence to support what
you're saying. <br/>
ARCHER: I've seen it happen. I've been to the future. Four hundred
years into the future. <br/>
DEGRA: You expect me to believe that? <br/>
ARCHER: There's an artefact in my right pocket. Take it. Go ahead. <br/>
DEGRA: (unzipping the pocket on Archer's sleeve) An initiation medal. <br/>
ARCHER: Have it quantum dated. The results will back me up. <br/>
DEGRA: You could have gotten it anywhere. <br/>
ARCHER: Listen to me, you son of a bitch. It wasn't any easier for me
to swallow this than it is for you, but you'd better understand
something. If you destroy Earth, you won't just be eliminating my
species, you'll be eliminating your own. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Degra's ship]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DEGRA: The quantum dating confirms it. It's from
the future. <br/>
HUMANOID: That doesn't prove the human's telling the truth. <br/>
ARBOREAL If there's any truth in what he's saying, it means we can't
trust her. <br/>
DEGRA: It also means she's been dealing with the Reptilians secretly. <br/>
HUMANOID: Archer told you this? <br/>
DEGRA: He said he saw Reptilians on Earth, in a place called Detroit,
over a hundred years in the past. <br/>
ARBOREAL: The past. <br/>
HUMANOID: So now he's a time traveller! <br/>
DEGRA: According to the human, they were developing a bioweapon. <br/>
ARBOREAL: The Council prohibited that. <br/>
DEGRA: He spoke of it in great detail. If the Reptilians wanted to keep
their actions a secret, the past would be a good place to do it. <br/>
ARBOREAL: How would they get to the past? <br/>
DEGRA: She may have taken them. <br/>
ARBOREAL: We have to investigate this. <br/>
DEGRA: And quickly. The weapon's been moved to a safe location, but
it's nearly ready to be deployed. <br/>
HUMANOID: The Council must be informed. <br/>
ARBOREAL: Reptilians sit on the Council, or have you forgotten. If they
did go behind our backs we shouldn't reveal what we've learned. Not
yet. <br/>
HUMANOID: What about the aquatics? <br/>
ARBOREAL: We can inform them in secret. <br/>
HUMANOID: All of this collusion is dangerous. The Council is
fracturing. We can't forget who the real enemy is. <br/>
DEGRA: We may not know who the real enemy is. </font></p>

TUCKER: Why do I get the feeling you haven't thought this through? <br/>
T'POL: You have made your objection clear. Now return to the Bridge. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm not just going to sit still and watch you fly off and die. <br/>
T'POL: I gave you an order. <br/>

ARCHER: That we trust each other. <br/>
HUMANOID: You were captured behind the controls of a ship armed with
explosives, and you're asking for our trust? <br/>
ARCHER: You're building a weapon that could destroy my world. I had to
try and stop you. <br/>
HUMANOID: And now that your mission's failed, you want to negotiate. <br/>
ARCHER: Just consider what I said. <br/>
HUMANOID: You maintain that by destroying your world we'll be ensuring
our own annihilation. <br/>
ARCHER: That's right. <br/>
HUMANOID: Because it's humankind that ultimately saves the Xindi from
these Sphere Builders. <br/>
ARCHER: We're both fighting the wrong enemy. <br/>
HUMANOID: I'm afraid it'll take more than this antique to convince us. <br/>
DEGRA: Quantum dating has produced inaccurate results before. <br/>
ARCHER: Do you believe these results are inaccurate? Let me speak to
this Council of yours, present my case. <br/>
DEGRA: Some members of the Council would sooner execute you than
listen. <br/>
ARCHER: Then help me change their minds. <br/>
