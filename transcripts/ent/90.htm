Ambassador's decided to fight in place of his underling? <br/>
ARCHER: Not the Ambassador. <br/>

ship opening.) <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VRAX: This mission was supposed to cause dissension
in the region. It's had the opposite effect. <br/>
VALDORE: Senator, you have a right <br/>
VRAX: The Andorians and Tellarites have formed an alliance. They're
working together for the first time in history. <br/>
VALDORE: It won't last. <br/>
VRAX: The group of senators doesn't share your optimism. They're
presenting a motion to cancel this mission. <br/>
VALDORE: That would be a mistake. <br/>
VRAX: The mistake was mine when I supported this endeavour. Do you
realise how you've weakened my position? <br/>
VALDORE: When this is over, you'll be First Consul. <br/>
VRAX: After a failure of this magnitude, I could be dead. <br/>
VALDORE: This isn't a failure. It's a setback. We have to deal with the
humans. They are the ones that brought the Andorians and Tellarites
together. The second Drone ship is armed and ready for battle. With two
ships, I can deliver a devastating blow. We will hunt down Enterprise
and destroy it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's Starlog, supplemental. A transport ship
is returning the Tellarite Ambassador to his homeworld, but Shran has
offered to stay and help us track down the marauder. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">T'POL: The Drone is being operated by telepresence.
It's a process which allows a vessel to be controlled from a remote
location. <br/>
SHRAN: We experimented with that years ago. Nothing came of it. <br/>
T'POL: A pilot can operate the Drone from a great distance, over many
light years. <br/>
REED: So, there really was no one on that ship. <br/>
TUCKER: And the people running it are back on their homeworld, safe and
sound. <br/>
T'POL: Essentially. <br/>
TUCKER: Doesn't seem fair. <br/>
ARCHER: Is there any way to interrupt this telepresence? <br/>
T'POL: I'm still reviewing the data Commander Tucker brought back, but
I believe we can construct our own telepresence unit. <br/>
TUCKER: And use it to hijack their ship? <br/>
T'POL: Doubtful. The most we can hope for is to interfere with their
navigation. <br/>
ARCHER: Get started. <br/>
T'POL: There is one problem. The data from the marauder also contained
a brain wave pattern. I believe it belongs to the pilot. <br/>
PHLOX: I've analyzed it. The individual is highly telepathic. <br/>
T'POL: Apparently, telepathy is necessary to operate the device. <br/>
ARCHER: Vulcans have telepathic powers. <br/>
PHLOX: Not to this extent. <br/>
ARCHER: Can you identify the species? <br/>
PHLOX: There's no exact match in my database. However, the nearest
genome is Andorian. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NIJIL: The humans did considerable damage to the
Bridge. We'll have to replace the entire receiver array. <br/>
VALDORE: Assign every spare man to the repair crew. <br/>
NIJIL: The ship isn't what concerns me. It's the pilot. <br/>
VALDORE: What about him? <br/>
NIJIL: Operating the vessel is extremely taxing. <br/>
VALDORE: He'll have at least three days to rest. <br/>
NIJIL: That won't be enough. He's suffering from severe mental fatigue.
Piloting one ship would be difficult enough, but two <br/>
VALDORE: Then you'll have to increase the stimulants. <br/>
NIJIL: The dosage is already at a dangerous level. He could be
permanently damaged. He could die. <br/>
VALDORE: If I didn't know you better, I would say you're more concerned
with this creature's well-being than you are with this mission. <br/>
NIJIL: Without the pilot, there would be no mission. <br/>
VALDORE: Just keep him alive long enough to destroy the Earth ship.
After that, his health is of little consequence. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARCHER: Come in. <br/>
SHRAN: I just received a transmission. Our scientists identified the
brain wave pattern. <br/>
ARCHER: And? <br/>
SHRAN: It's from my world, but it's not from any Andorian you'd know.
It's Aenar. They're a kind of subspecies. Blind ice-dwellers. For most
of our history, they were considered a myth, stories we told our
children, but fifty years ago, they were discovered living in the
Northern Wastes. They're extremely secretive. I can count on one hand
the number of Andorians who've seen one face-to-face. <br/>
ARCHER: Could they have built a ship like the marauder? <br/>
SHRAN: I seriously doubt they have the capacity. There are only a few
thousand of them left, and even if they could, they're pacifists. They
don't believe in violence. <br/>
ARCHER: One of them does. <br/>
SHRAN: It seems that way. <br/>
ARCHER: We need to find out who's controlling that ship. <br/>
SHRAN: Agreed. <br/>
ARCHER: (into comm.) Travis. <br/>
TRAVIS [OC]: Yes, sir? <br/>
ARCHER: Set a course for Andoria, maximum warp. </font></p>

and thick rubber tubing.) <br/>
T'POL: You should rest. <br/>
TUCKER: I just need a second. <br/>
T'POL: Phlox thinks it's too soon for you to return to duty. <br/>
TUCKER: Phlox? You were talking to him about me? <br/>
T'POL: It came up in conversation. <br/>
TUCKER: Right. Well, I don't have the option of taking a break. The
Captain needs this done fast. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>
(T'Pol is working on modifying a biobed.) </font><br/>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">T'POL:
I can manage. <br/>
TUCKER: You might be the best there is at crunching numbers, but when
it comes to actually sticking things together, you're a little out of
your league. These work better when you strip off the duranite caps.
Don't ask me why, they just do. <br/>
T'POL: I'll make a note of that. <br/>
TUCKER: You know, when I was on that ship with Malcolm I was convinced
I was going to die. You ever been there? <br/>
T'POL: Since Enterprise was launched, we've all been near death on more
than one occasion. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm not talking close scrapes. I mean when you're in a bad
situation, and you know this is it, there's no way out, and you have
time to think about it. <br/>
T'POL: In the Expanse, when we were attempting to destroy Sphere forty
one, I didn't believe we'd survive. <br/>
TUCKER: What went through your mind? <br/>
T'POL: Whether or not to transfer auxiliary power to the deflector
array. Why do you ask? <br/>
TUCKER: Just curious. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Enterprise has arrived at a blue planet with a
ring system and at least two fair-sized moons.) <br/>
REED: The Aenar compound is surrounded by a dampening field. Once
you're inside, you won't be able to contact the ship. I'd feel much
better about this if you'd take a couple of MACOs with you. <br/>
SHRAN: We go in there with a show of force, we won't get a thing out of
them. <br/>
ARCHER: We're going alone. <br/>
REED: Captain, we don't know anything about these people. <br/>

Twenty eight below? <br/>
SHRAN: Lucky for you, it's the middle of summer. <br/>
ARCHER: Yeah. <br/>
SHRAN: The entrance is twenty metres ahead. The Vulcans say the desert
teaches men the meaning of endurance. But it's the ice that forges real
strength. <br/>
ARCHER: It's hard to believe anything can survive here. <br/>
SHRAN: It isn't easy. Andorian cities are built underground to take
advantage of geothermal energy. I didn't see the sun till I was
fifteen. <br/>
(They wend their way through ice walls, and Shran wobbles then falls to
his knees.) <br/>
ARCHER: Careful, Shran. You don't have your balance back yet. <br/>
SHRAN: Hands off, pinkskin. These tunnels branch out for thousands of
kilometres. Not a good place to get lost. </font></p>

VALDORE: Will he be ready? <br/>
NIJIL: I'll make sure that he is. <br/>
VALDORE: Spoken like a soldier. <br/>
NIJIL: I'm a scientist. <br/>
VALDORE: We're all soldiers, Nijil, from the moment we're born. When we
forget that we invite disaster. You know I was once a senator? <br/>
NIJIL: No. <br/>
VALDORE: Many years ago. Vrax and I were colleagues. I even considered
him a friend. <br/>
NIJIL: What happened? <br/>
VALDORE: I made the mistake of challenging the precept of unlimited
expansion. I asked the question. Is conquest truly the best course for
our people? And I was expelled. <br/>
NIJIL: I'm sorry. <br/>
VALDORE: I'm not trying to evoke your pity. I want you to learn from my
experience. When I was led away from the Senate chamber, I vowed never
to repeat my error and never to forget my purpose. <br/>
NIJIL: I understand. <br/>

their path.) <br/>
SHRAN: Ice-bores. Worms. They live in the ice. Generate heat through a
chemical reaction. Big swarm came through here a day or two ago. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sure Phlox would love to get his hands on one. <br/>
SHRAN: Best to avoid them. When I was a boy, I stumbled into a large
den, wound up with third-degree burns over half my body. <br/>

suddenly falls the rest of the way, and lands screaming in pain with a

ARCHER: Hold still. Bleeding's stopped, but if you move it could start
again. <br/>

PHLOX: I can connect someone to the unit, but it'll be dangerous. <br/>
TUCKER: How dangerous? <br/>
PHLOX: If the interface malfunctions, there could be severe neurolytic
shock, possibly resulting in brain damage. <br/>
TUCKER: There's got to be some way we can make it safer. <br/>
PHLOX: Diagnostics will only tell us so much, I'm afraid. <br/>
T'POL: When can we test it? <br/>
PHLOX: A day. <br/>
TUCKER: I want to be the first one to try it out. <br/>
T'POL: You're not telepathic. It wouldn't be a true measure of the
unit's effectiveness. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, at least we'll find out if it causes brain damage. <br/>
T'POL: I'll test the unit. <br/>
TUCKER: You're the ranking officer. Too risky. <br/>
T'POL: Considering what's at stake, the risk is acceptable. <br/>
TUCKER: We could at least wait until the Captain gets back. <br/>

returns. That means conducting a full series of tests. The discussion's

Chancellor contacted us. <br/>

LISSAN: We assign our leaders as the need arises. For this occasion, I
have been chosen as Speaker. <br/>
ARCHER: I take it you know why we're here. <br/>
LISSAN: I know what the Andorians have told us. Someone's been
attacking your ships, and you believe we're involved. <br/>

thoughts. <br/>

LISSAN: Some of those facets are in conflict. <br/>
SHRAN: That explains a lot. <br/>
ARCHER: Shran. <br/>
LISSAN: The evidence you've gathered appears irrefutable. It seems
there was an Aenar controlling that ship. <br/>
ARCHER: But you're sceptical. <br/>
LISSAN: We're a nonviolent people. That a member of our race could
cause so much death, it's extremely disturbing. <br/>
ARCHER: Do you have any idea who it could be? <br/>
LISSAN: There's one possibility. <br/>
SHRAN: Who? <br/>
LISSAN: A year ago, one of our citizens disappeared while collecting
ice-bores. We assumed he'd been killed in an accident, but we never
found his body. <br/>
SHRAN: Now you know why. <br/>
LISSAN: Gareb would not be doing this voluntarily. <br/>
ARCHER: You think he was abducted? <br/>

ARCHER: We're hoping it will disrupt the signal that's controlling the
marauder. <br/>

worried. They're going to be worried about me now. <br/>

JHAMEL: I won't abandon my brother. What's it like, your ship? <br/>

PHLOX: You know the risks. So does Commander T'Pol. Commander, she's
doing her job. <br/>
TUCKER: She's going to hurt herself. <br/>
PHLOX: Take my advice. Don't interfere. <br/>
TUCKER: I can't believe I'm getting this from you now. Has everyone on
this ship gone crazy? <br/>
PHLOX: Not everyone. <br/>
TUCKER: Oh, I'm crazy? <br/>
PHLOX: It's not your fault. As far as I know, there are no species in
the galaxy that have mastered the art of mixing romance and vocation. <br/>
TUCKER: You're the last one that should be giving me a lecture. Vulcan
neuro-pressure was your idea. <br/>
PHLOX: You were having trouble sleeping. <br/>
TUCKER: What the hell am I going to do? <br/>

ARCHER: How? <br/>
JHAMEL: They're not letting us see the path to the surface. <br/>
SHRAN; How could that be possible? <br/>
(An image of Lissan flickers on the path in front of them.) <br/>
LISSAN: It's time to come back. <br/>
JHAMEL: I can't. <br/>
LISSAN; They're fighting a war. Do you want to be a part of that? <br/>
JHAMEL: I don't want to fight anyone. I want to help my brother. <br/>
LISSAN; Help him by standing up for what we believe in. <br/>
ARCHER: She's doing what she thinks is right. <br/>
LISSAN: She's betraying her people. <br/>
ARCHER: That's not true. Shouldn't she be allowed to follow her own
conscience? <br/>
LISSAN; She's not following her conscience. <br/>
ARCHER: How do you know? Have you read her mind? I thought that was
against your custom. <br/>
LISSAN: Jhamel. <br/>
JHAMEL: Take my thoughts. <br/>
