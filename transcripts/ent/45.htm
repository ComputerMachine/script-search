brought to stand in the middle of the room, under a spotlight.) <br/>

How do you respond? <br/>

PHLOX: Xenopolycythemia can be highly contagious. I'm surprised they
haven't put you in isolation. <br/>(The guard slowly backs away and leaves
them alone.) <br/>PHLOX: Any residual symptoms? Fever, dizziness? <br/>
ARCHER: Just a scratchy throat. <br/>
PHLOX: Let's have a look. <br/>
ARCHER: When did you get here? <br/>
PHLOX: Two days ago, but they refused to let us see you. <br/>
ARCHER: Enemies of the state aren't allowed visitors. <br/>
PHLOX: T'Pol was finally able to convince them that your condition
necessitated a visit from your doctor. <br/>
ARCHER: Very thoughtful of her. <br/>
PHLOX: She sends her regards, and she wanted me to assure you that
Starfleet, and the Vulcan High Command are doing everything possible to
get you released. <br/>
ARCHER: Are they having any luck? <br/>
PHLOX: Not yet, but she and Commander Tucker have begun exploring other
options for regaining your freedom. <br/>
ARCHER: When this is over, whatever the outcome, I'm counting on them
to get Enterprise safely out of Klingon territory. <br/>
PHLOX: I'll let them know. How are your accommodations? <br/>
ARCHER: Not so bad. Can't say I'm a big fan of Klingon cuisine. <br/>
PHLOX: It may not appear appetising, but it seems like a good source of
protein. I suggest you eat it. (Kolos enters.)<br/>

expect out there? <br/>

ORAK: The Duras I called to testify is Commander of the battle cruiser
Bortas. <br/>
DURAS: I was recently reduced in rank. <br/>
ORAK: A distinguished Klingon warrior, stripped of his command. Did the
accused have anything to do with your disgrace? <br/>
DURAS: Yes. <br/>
ORAK: Go on, Weapons Officer Duras. <br/>
DURAS: A group of rebels had fled the Klingon Protectorate at
Raatooras. I was commanded to bring these traitors to justice. We'd
followed their warp trail to a system just outside Klingon territory. </font></p>

them immediately. <br/>
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: By whose authority? <br/>
DURAS: The Chancellor of the Klingon High Council. <br/>
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: I don't know your Chancellor, and I don't give

I'm going to support their revolt. <br/>

your First Officer didn't kill you for such a failure. You're

ARCHER: You're not going to question him? <br/>
KOLOS: He'd say nothing that would help you. <br/>
MAGISTRATE: Do you have any further evidence to present? <br/>
ORAK: No, Magistrate. Duras' testimony is clear. He was attempting to
carry out his mission to bring enemies of the Empire to justice. But
this aggressor, this human, conspired with them to disgrace a proud
warrior and foment rebellion. There can be no doubt that he is our
enemy as well. Captain Archer claims to be innocent. Innocent of what?
This tribunal has already been far too lenient. We haven't accused his
crew, or his government. He's fortunate we haven't dispatched a fleet
of warships to his homeworld, but we do demand that he be held
responsible for the crimes he has committed. We demand that he receive
the most severe punishment our laws decree! <br/>
MAGISTRATE: Do you have a response? <br/>
KOLOS: No, Magistrate. <br/>

ARCHER: It's a little underdone. <br/>
KOLOS: I told you to remain silent. You should have listened to me. <br/>
ARCHER: Sorry if I interfered with your legal strategy. <br/>
KOLOS: My strategy may yet spare your life. I've spoken with the
Magistrate. He's willing to show you mercy if you co-operate. <br/>
ARCHER: How? <br/>
KOLOS: Tell him where to find the rebels. <br/>
ARCHER: I told you, they're not rebels. <br/>
KOLOS: It doesn't matter what you believe. They're subject to the laws
of the Empire. There's nothing you can say that will change that. <br/>
ARCHER: I haven't been able to say anything. <br/>
KOLOS: Where did you take them? Another ship? A planet? Do you
understand what will happen if you don't tell them? <br/>
ARCHER: I've a pretty good idea. <br/>
KOLOS: I'm offering you a way to save your life. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's say I did co-operate. What would happen to these people? <br/>
KOLOS: They would be charged with treason. <br/>
ARCHER: And end up in a court like this one? Tell the magistrate I'm
going to pass on his offer. <br/>
KOLOS: Only a fool would sacrifice himself for people he barely knows. <br/>
ARCHER: I know them well enough. They're good people, and I won't turn
them over. If you'd let me testify, tell my side of the story, it might
become clear why I helped them. But from what I've seen, you're all
perfectly happy to ignore what you don't want to hear. <br/>
KOLOS: Don't be so quick to accuse me of sharing their interpretation
of the law. <br/>
ARCHER: No? What's your interpretation? <br/>
KOLOS: I became an Advocate many years ago. They were different times. <br/>
ARCHER: Better or worse? <br/>
KOLOS: The courts were more willing to listen. <br/>
ARCHER: Then maybe you should remind them of those different times.
Nothing like a good history lesson. <br/>
KOLOS: I'm an old man. Too old to challenge the rules. <br/>
ARCHER: Even if your client's life depends on it? I get the feeling
you're as frustrated as I am. That you want to stand up to them. But
you've given up. You're afraid of them. <br/>

our offer? <br/>

ORAK: Irrelevant! I urge you to end these proceedings. <br/>
KOLOS: I am within my rights to present further testimony. <br/>
ORAK: You're speaking of archaic rights. <br/>
KOLOS: Surely I don't need to remind the Magistrate, the judicial
charter of Koloth states an advocate is entitled to challenge the
charges at any point during the tribunal. To my knowledge, that charter
has not been cast aside. From the time of Kahless, our courts have
stood as a forum where justice is dispensed with honour. Now, will my
case be heard, or will it not? <br/>
MAGISTRATE: Call your witness. <br/>
KOLOS: Identify yourself. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm Captain Jonathan Archer of the Earth Starship Enterprise. <br/>
ORAK: Do you admit, Captain Archer, that you gave aid and comfort to a
vessel fleeing the Empire? <br/>
ARCHER: We answered a distress call. They were starving. Their life
support was failing. <br/>
ORAK: Their health isn't at issue here. You helped them to escape! <br/>
KOLOS: Will my client be allowed to testify, or not? <br/>

has shown you. Continue. <br/>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KOLOS:
You say the Bortas fired first. <br/>
ARCHER: Yes. <br/>
KOLOS: And you tried to reach an accommodation with Captain Duras? <br/>
ARCHER: He refused. <br/>
ORAK: Duras was under no obligation to accommodate this human. <br/>
KOLOS: So you were simply defending your ship when you attacked the
Bortas? <br/>
ARCHER: Yes. <br/>
KOLOS: And then what happened? <br/>
ARCHER: We left the system and took the refugees with us. <br/>
KOLOS: You could have destroyed the Bortas. Why didn't you? <br/>
ARCHER: Because Captain Duras is not my enemy. <br/>
KOLOS: Not your enemy. I submit to this tribunal that Captain Archer is
guilty. Guilty of meddling in Klingon affairs on more than one
occasion. In fact, I've discovered his name is well known to the High
Council. The accused once stood before the Chancellor himself and
exposed a Suliban plot that would have thrown the Empire into civil
war. <br/>
ORAK: That is absurd. <br/>
KOLOS: The facts are on record. Perhaps the Prosecutor has grown
complacent with his research. The records of the Imperial Fleet also
mention this man. His ship was instrumental in the rescue of the
Klingon Raptor, the Somraw, from the dense atmosphere of a gas giant. <br/>
ORAK: Even if this is true, it has nothing to do with this case. <br/>
KOLOS: It has everything to do with this case. It shows a pattern in
Archer's behaviour that was repeated in his encounter with Captain
Duras. Yes, he may be self-righteous, but his meddling has saved a
Klingon ship and perhaps the fate of the Empire itself. If Captain
Archer is guilty, he is guilty of nothing more than being a nuisance,
and hardly worth the attention of this tribunal. And if he must be
punished, let the punishment fit that crime. </font></p>

How long should it take for a verdict? <br/>
KOLOS: It usually doesn't take long at all. I must have been more
persuasive than I thought. <br/>
ARCHER: Thanks for what you've done for me. <br/>
KOLOS: Don't thank me yet. The odds are still very much against us.

KOLOS: Don't feel badly if you can't stomach it. <br/>
ARCHER: I didn't say that. <br/>(He has some more.) <br/>ARCHER: How many cases have you won?
<br/>
KOLOS: Oh, I'm not sure. Over two hundred. But that was a long time
ago, when the tribunal was a forum for the truth and not a tool for the
warrior class. <br/>
ARCHER: There are other classes? <br/>
KOLOS: You didn't believe all Klingons were soldiers? <br/>
ARCHER: I guess I did. <br/>
KOLOS: My father was a teacher. My mother, a biologist at the
university. They encouraged me to take up the law. Now all young people
want to do is take up weapons as soon as they can hold them. They're
told there's honour in victory, any victory. What honour is there in a
victory over a weaker opponent? Had Duras destroyed that ship he would
have been lauded as a hero of the Empire for murdering helpless
refugees. We were a great society not so long ago, when honour was
earned through integrity and acts of true courage, not senseless
bloodshed. <br/>
ARCHER: For thousands of years, my people had similar problems. We
fought three world wars that almost destroyed us. Whole generations
were nearly wiped out. <br/>
KOLOS: What changed? <br/>
ARCHER: A few courageous people began to realise they could make a
difference. </font></p>

MAGISTRATE: I have weighed the evidence carefully. Advocate Kolos has
made an impressive case, much to the surprise of this tribunal. Based
upon his arguments I am inclined to believe that the accused was a
victim of his own foolishness. He was not fomenting rebellion. But, as
Prosecutor Orak has made clear, the laws of the Empire have been
violated and Captain Archer must be held accountable for his actions
regardless of his intent. I therefore find the accused guilty as
charged. (popular acclamation from the galleries) However! However this
tribunal cannot ignore his actions assisting the Klingon people.
Therefore the sentence of death is commuted. Silence! Jonathan Archer,
you are condemned to the dilithium mines on the penal colony of Rura
Pente for the remainder of your life. Remove the prisoner. <br/>
ORAK: I protest. <br/>
MAGISTRATE: I wouldn't protest too loudly, Prosecutor. You've won your
case. <br/>
ORAK: And I compliment the magistrate on his just ruling. But the
sentence for these crimes must be death. <br/>
KOLOS: The sentence is death. You condemn this man to Rura Pente. What
is the life expectancy of a prisoner there? Six months, a year at the
most? And you expect us to believe that this is an act of mercy. <br/>
MAGISTRATE: This court has shown you a great deal of patience,
Advocate. Don't test my limits any further. <br/>
KOLOS: I ask for no special treatment. Only that my client be judged
fairly, as any Klingon would be judged. But it has been many years
since anyone stood in this chamber and received justice. <br/>
MAGISTRATE: Watch your words. You insult the honour of this tribunal. <br/>
KOLOS: Honour? You acknowledged that Captain Archer acted with
conviction and integrity, and how do you reward him? With this grand
public display of compassion before sending him to his death in a
frozen cave. <br/>
MAGISTRATE: Enough! <br/>
KOLOS: Forgive me if I fail to see the honour in that. <br/>
MAGISTRATE: You are in contempt of this tribunal. Since you have such
admiration for the prisoner, you will join him on Rura Pente for a
period of one year. Remove them both. </font></p>

The Vulcan High Command will continue to lobby for the Captain's
release. <br/>
TUCKER: So what do we do? <br/>
T'POL: The Klingons have only allowed us to remain here during the
trial. We're to leave immediately. <br/>

T'POL: We don't have a choice. <br/>
TRAVIS: What's this Rura Pente like? <br/>
T'POL: It's quite inhospitable. <br/>
REED: They're going to have to get there. <br/>
T'POL: We're deep inside Klingon territory. A rescue attempt is out of
the question. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm willing to risk it. <br/>
T'POL: The Captain isn't. He made it clear he didn't want us to
endanger the crew on his behalf. <br/>
TUCKER: So you're saying we just forget about him? <br/>
T'POL: I'm saying a rescue isn't an option, but there are diplomatic
channels. <br/>
TUCKER: We tried diplomatic channels. <br/>
T'POL: Not all of them. I've dealt with several Klingon bureaucrats in
the past. Some of them can be persuaded. Mister Mayweather, take us out
of orbit. </font></p>

REED: T'Pol knows a few Klingon officials from her days in the Ministry
of Security. One of them put us in touch with a corrections officer who
was willing to look the other way for the right price. I came on one of
the dilithium barges. We bribed the captain to bring us here and take
us back to Enterprise. <br/>

twenty of them standing in that tribunal playing my part, holding my
tongue, and all the while honourable men were being sent to places like
this without the benefit of a defence. And then I was assigned your
case. You told me that on your world a few courageous people made a
difference. I'm not sure I have the courage, but I know I'll never be
able to restore honour to my people living as a fugitive. <br/>
ARCHER: You realise what that means. You said most prisoners here don't
survive a year. <br/>
