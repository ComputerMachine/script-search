TUCKER: It's been weeks since our last session. We've all been under a
lot of stress lately. I thought it might do us both some good. <br/>
T'POL: I think we should discontinue these treatments. <br/>
TUCKER: Why? <br/>
T'POL: You've become quite skilled with the postures I've shown you. <br/>

neuro-pressure, I came because I'm worried about you. <br/>
T'POL: Worried? <br/>
TUCKER: You've been keeping to yourself a lot lately, even more than
usual. You spend every free moment in your quarters, you even asked
Chef to bring your meals here. <br/>
T'POL: The Mess hall's heavily damaged. Where do you suggest I eat? <br/>
TUCKER: Come on, you've got to admit you've been avoiding me ever since
the two of us, you know, when we <br/>
T'POL: Had sexual relations. <br/>
TUCKER: That's real romantic when you put it that way. <br/>
T'POL: I told you, what happened was an exploration, not the prelude to
an intimate relationship. <br/>
TUCKER: I never said I wanted a relationship. <br/>
T'POL: Neither did I. <br/>

two ships inside the nebula. <br/>
T'POL: It would appear that his information is out of date. There are
at least half a dozen ships. <br/>
ARCHER: According to Degra, they're not very tolerant of trespassers.
How close are they to the corridor? <br/>
T'POL: Within sixty thousand kilometres. <br/>
ARCHER: We'll ionise the hull. That should mask our approach for a
while. <br/>
REED: I suggest we enter here, above this layer of metreon gas. It
should reflect our engine signature, create multiple sensor ghosts,
false readings. If we're lucky they won't know which one to fire at. </font></p>

DEGRA: Archer's ship was heavily damaged. They wouldn't stand a chance
against one of our cruisers. <br/>
ARBOREAL: There may be other human ships in the Expanse. <br/>
DEGRA: Those readings were never confirmed. <br/>
HUMANOID: This discussion is pointless. You won't be allowed to bring
Archer before the Council. <br/>
DEGRA: Then we won't ask their permission. <br/>
HUMANOID: He'll be killed the moment he steps into the Council chamber.
<br/>
DEGRA: They have to listen. His allegations are too important to simply
dismiss. <br/>
HUMANOID: Do you believe Archer's being truthful? <br/>
ARBOREAL: I don't think he's told us everything, but I can't explain
the evidence that we saw. <br/>
HUMANOID: The humans could have manufactured this evidence. They'd do
anything to save their planet. <br/>
DEGRA: If Archer is telling the truth, then all the Council's efforts
will have been for nothing. <br/>
HUMANOID: Reptilians patrol this side of the corridor. They'll destroy
the human vessel as soon as it comes through. <br/>
DEGRA: I've already considered that. We can protect them. <br/>

officer. <br/>
(A woman with a protrusion all down her forehead to her nose.) <br/>

LORIAN [OC]: The trip through the corridor took only a few seconds, but
it didn't take long before your crew realised something was wrong. <br/>

T'POL: We've travelled eleven point six light years. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LORIAN: But it was
over a hundred years early. We're not entirely sure why this happened,
but we have a theory. We think your impulse wake destabilised the
corridor, causing it to shift in time. <br/>
ARCHER: Why didn't you, didn't we, go back through it? <br/>
KARYN: T'Pol eventually determined that ships can only travel through
this corridor in one direction. </font></p>

we'll be getting underway. <br/>
T'POL: What course should we set? <br/>
ARCHER: Even if we found a way out of the Expanse, we can't go back to
Earth. We'd be contaminating our own culture, our own history. <br/>
T'POL: Cochran's warp flight won't happen for another twenty six years.
<br/>
ARCHER: Maybe there's a way we can use this to our advantage. <br/>
T'POL: How? <br/>
ARCHER: We know the date when Earth is attacked by the first Xindi
probe. We may be able to figure out a way to warn them, or even prevent
the attack. <br/>
T'POL: The probe won't be deployed for more than a hundred years. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LORIAN: Who'd have to complete this mission. It
was only a matter of time before the first child was born. Enterprise
became a generational ship. You showed your children how to operate and
maintain it's systems, and they did the same for their children. <br/>
ARCHER: You've been flying around the Expanse for over a century? <br/>
T'POL: That's unlikely. Enterprise doesn't have fuel or provisions for
such a long journey. <br/>
LORIAN: You've hardly changed, mother. <br/>
T'POL: I beg your pardon? <br/>
LORIAN: You made alliances with other species, traded technology for
food and supplies. You even acquired a few alien crew members. We did
our best to carry out the mission you gave us, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: To destroy the first Xindi probe. But you failed. <br/>
LORIAN: We had years to prepare, but in the end we were only one
starship. Our weapons were no match for the Xindi. We couldn't stop the
first attack, but we can help you stop the second. We can make certain
you reach the rendezvous with Degra this time. <br/>
T'POL: You said we couldn't travel through the corridor. <br/>
KARYN: You won't need to. We've encountered dozens of species. Some of
them shared their propulsion technology with us. <br/>
(She hands over a PADD.) <br/>
LORIAN: We got these schematics from Haridan traders. We can use them
to modify your injector assembly. You'll be able to travel at warp six
point nine for brief intervals. <br/>
T'POL: The hull wasn't designed for that speed. <br/>
LORIAN: We'll show you how to reinforce structural integrity. You'll be
able to reach Degra in less than two days. <br/>
ARCHER: You've made these modifications on your own ship? <br/>
LORIAN: Our plasma injectors are too old. They can't handle the stress.
But your injectors are practically new. You're still not convinced. <br/>
ARCHER: You've got to admit, it's a lot to accept. <br/>
LORIAN: We don't have a lot of time. You need to start these
modifications. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm not comfortable doing that just yet. <br/>
KARYN: Perhaps we should go to Sickbay. Phlox can confirm our identity.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: They are who they claim to be. Most of the
young woman's ancestors were human, but there are also chromosomes from
three species I've never seen before. These genetic markers belong to
you, Captain. She would appear to be your great grand-daughter. I've
compared your genetic profile with Lorian's. These base pair sequences
could only have come from you. <br/>
T'POL: These chromosomes are human. <br/>
PHLOX: That's correct. They came from his father. <br/>
T'POL: That's impossible. Vulcans and humans have never been able to
reproduce. <br/>
PHLOX: According to Lorian, I discovered, or rather I will discover, a
method of successfully combining human and Vulcan genomes. <br/>
ARCHER: Who's the father? <br/>
PHLOX: Commander Tucker. </font></p>

and I see my father. Right here, around the eyes. Now the ears, those
are your mothers. Wait a minute, you smiled. <br/>
LORIAN: I wasn't raised with the same inhibitions most Vulcans have. My
human side has allowed me to find a balance between emotion and logic.
I've even been known to tell a joke on occasion. Would you hand me the
coil spanner? I learned almost everything I know by studying your
engineering logs. <br/>
TUCKER: Pretty dry reading. I hope I gave you some hands-on training as
well. <br/>
LORIAN: I'm sure you would have. You should reinitialise the start-up
routine before going to warp six. <br/>
TUCKER: There's something you're not telling me. <br/>
LORIAN: You died when I was fourteen. <br/>
TUCKER: What happened? <br/>
LORIAN: I'm not sure we should be discussing your future. <br/>
TUCKER: It couldn't have been easy growing up without the old man
around. Sorry I wasn't there. <br/>
LORIAN: You were a good father. It's strange being able to tell you
that. <br/>
<i>[Deleted scene]<br/>
TUCKER: Maybe you could tell me more about your mother. How the two of
us got together. <br/>
LORIAN: She never told me. Mother rarely talked about you. I think it
was too painful. She cared for you a great deal. <br/>
TUCKER: Doesn't seem like we're talking about the same T'Pol. <br/>
LORIAN: Your relationship was somewhat contentious. But you were always
affectionate towards each other. <br/>
TUCKER: I just can't see myself married to her. I suppose if we were
marooned on a desert island. <br/>
LORIAN: We should finish up with these injectors. </i> </font></p>

ARCHER: You're not entirely human yourself. <br/>
KARYN: My great grandmother was Ikaaran. <br/>
ARCHER: Was that? <br/>
KARYN: Your wife. Her name was Esilia. You rescued her ship from an
anomaly field. <br/>
ARCHER: You know, finding your ship explains a few things. When the
Xindi took me prisoner they asked me one question over and over. They
wanted to know how many ships Starfleet had in the Expanse. <br/>

<br/>
T'POL: Not really. <br/>
TUCKER: You should. He seems like a good kid. <br/>
T'POL: He's hardly a kid. He's more than a hundred years old. <br/>
TUCKER: Only in the Expanse could I have a son who's nearly three times
my age. Who would have thought you and me, huh? Lorian says we're going
to be married in a traditional Vulcan ceremony. It's going to take me
weeks to learn to pronounce the vows. You know where we're going to
have our honeymoon? Cargo bay three. He says I'll fill it up with sand
that we dug up from a passing asteroid. I'm even supposed to (laughs)
I'm even supposed to manufacture a palm tree. <br/>
T'POL: It's ridiculous to assume those events are going to happen. Hand
me the flux coupler. <br/>
TUCKER: Aren't you at all curious about how you and I are supposed to
end up together? <br/>
T'POL: The fact that our counterparts married doesn't mean that we'll
do the same. <br/>
TUCKER: You're afraid to admit that under the right circumstances you
could have feelings for me. Maybe you have them already. <br/>
T'POL: I should have known this was a mistake. <br/>
TUCKER: What? <br/>
T'POL: Exploring human sexuality with you. You're obviously unable to
have a physical relationship without developing an emotional
attachment. <br/>
TUCKER: You know, all the other women on board must have been taken,
because I can't imagine any other reason why I would have married
someone as stubborn as you. I'll go help Rostov with the port manifold.

PHLOX: I can't believe this. My Rigellian parrot is still alive. I knew
they had long lifespans, but <br/>

PHLOX: Oh, yes. Eight members of their crew are suffering from
low-grade Nubilian fever. I'd like to vaccinate everyone on both ships.

you never knew existed. Did you know that I have nearly thirty living
descendants on that ship? I look forward to introducing them to my
wives on Denobula. <br/>
ARCHER: I suppose when this mission is over, most of their crew will
want to return to Earth. <br/>
PHLOX: From what I've gathered, your great grand-daughter would be more
at home on the bridge of a starship. <br/>
ARCHER: We seem to be cut from the same cloth. <br/>
PHLOX: Perhaps Starfleet will consider allowing children on board
starships one day. Admiral Forrest did let you bring Porthos. <br/>

the only logical course of action. <br/>

like living with the responsibility. Millions of people are dead

ARCHER: I'm sure your crew did everything they could to stop the probe.

LORIAN: I could have destroyed it. Years ago, I swore to my Captain on
his deathbed I'd save those seven million lives. You were the man I
made that promise to. I devoted my life to that mission. We knew the
co-ordinates of the launch platform, the exact minute the weapon was
going to be deployed. But our plan didn't work. I had one last chance.
Use Enterprise itself, set a collision course with the probe. But I
hesitated, my emotions took over. I couldn't give an order that would
kill my crew. By the time I realised my mistake it was too late, the
probe was gone. I won't let my emotions get in the way again. I will
not let Earth be destroyed. <br/>

have. There's someone on your ship who can help. <br/>

you'll trust him. The emotions he stirred in me were powerful and
frightening. I tried to push him away. If Enterprise hadn't been
