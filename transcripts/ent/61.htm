<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (In a
archetypal Western frontier town, four men on horseback ride down the
street to a tree. One has a noose put around his neck.) <br/>
BENNINGS: Any last words? <br/>
(The other end of the rope goes over a bough, and the knot slides round
to the back of the man's neck.) <br/>
SKAG: Go to hell. <br/>
BENNINGS: I didn't know Skags believed in hell. <br/>(He fires his pistol to
spook the horse and the Skag is left kicking alone in the air.) </font></p>

dead Skag is coffined.) <br/>
MACCREADY: Who's paying for the box? <br/>(The undertaker looks towards the lady
schoolteacher.) <br/>MACCREADY: I hope you're not planning to bury him in the cemetery. <br/>
BETHANY: His people don't bury their dead, but I wouldn't expect you to
know that. <br/>
MACCREADY: I'm sorry I didn't get there in time to stop them. <br/>
BETHANY: What difference would it have made? <br/>
MACCREADY: He'd have gotten a trial. <br/>
BETHANY: And the same people who lynched him would have been sitting on
the jury. <br/>
MACCREADY: Bethany, he killed a man. Self-defence or not, that's a
hanging offence for a Skag. <br/>
(As Bethany walks down the street, a familiar man walks over to a woman
wearing a scarf to cover the tips of her ears.) <br/>
ARCHER: What have you got? <br/>
T'POL: I've confirmed that they're human. Their DNA is a perfect match.<br/>
TUCKER: Looks pretty authentic, Captain, right down to the spittoons. <br/>
ARCHER: And the hangings. If these people are from Earth, how the hell
did they get here? <br/>(He goes down an alleyway.) <br/>ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Report. <br/>

they find out who we really are. Keep a low profile. <br/>

Morning. <br/>
STABLEHAND: Can I help you folks? <br/>
TUCKER: I hope so. We need a horse. <br/>
STABLEHAND: What happened to yours? <br/>
TUCKER: Excuse me? <br/>
STABLEHAND: It's a long way from the next town. How'd you get here? <br/>
T'POL: Our horses perished several miles north of your town from heat
exhaustion. <br/>
STABLEHAND: Well, you're lucky the sun vipers didn't get you, or those
Skags. <br/>(He gets a horse out of its stall.) <br/>STABLEHAND: Come on. This one here, four
years old, good stock. Twenty dollars, she's yours. <br/>
TUCKER: Sounds kind of steep. Don't suppose you'd be interested in a
trade? <br/>
STABLEHAND: Well, that depends what you've got to trade. <br/>(Tucker gets
out an harmonica and plays it.) <br/>STABLEHANDL Haven't seen one of these in years. <br/>
TUCKER: Look, I know it's not worth the horse, but we only need him for
a couple of hours. We just want to ride out and grab our gear. We'll be
back before you know it. Well, how about I leave my gun for collateral.
<br/>
STABLEHAND: You got yourself a deal, buddy. <br/>
(Tucker leads the horse out while the stablehand plays the harmonica.
He mounts, and offers his hand to T'Pol.) <br/>
T'POL: Do you have any experience riding these animals? <br/>
TUCKER: I've seen every John Ford western. <br/>
T'POL: Who? <br/>
TUCKER: How hard can it be? <br/>(T'Pol swings up behind him.) <br/>TUCKER: Better hold on. <br/>

Afternoon. <br/>
BARTENDER: What can I get you? <br/>
ARCHER: I'm passing through town. I was hoping I could sit in here for
a while till it cools down. <br/>
BARTENDER: Coffee's on the house. <br/>
ARCHER: Thanks. <br/>
BARTENDER: Where're you headed? <br/>
ARCHER: My brother's got a ranch down south. He said he could set me up
with some work. <br/>
BARTENDER: What's he raising, bluehorns? <br/>
ARCHER: How'd you know? <br/>
BARTENDER: Land down there's not good for much else. <br/>(Archer takes the
hot coffee and looks at the portrait over the bar.) <br/>BARTENDER: See the resemblance?
<br/>
ARCHER: Yeah. Yeah, I do. You're not telling me you're related to
Cooper Smith? <br/>(Archer reads the name plaque under the painting.)<br/>
BARTENDER: He's my ancestor. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll be damned. <br/>
BARTENDER: Yep. You're looking at the only direct descendant of the man
who overthrew the Skags. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll bet you've got some stories. <br/>
BARTENDER: Got a few I could tell you. <br/>(Three men enter.) <br/>
ARCHER: Friends of yours? <br/>
BARTENDER: Not particularly. <br/>
BENNINGS: How about a little service? <br/>
BARTENDER: What'll it be? <br/>
BENNINGS: Anything but that rot-gut you were pouring yesterday. <br/>(The
boy takes bottle and glasses to the table.) <br/>BENNINGS: Why don't you join us? <br/>
DRAYSIK: (a Skag, by the markings near his ears) You know I'm not
allowed to do that, Mister Bennings. <br/>
BENNINGS: It's Deputy Bennings, and I can bend a local ordnance if I
choose. Have a seat. (he sits) I imagine you could use a drink, after
what happened last night. Let's raise a glass to the dearly departed.
To dead Skags. <br/>(Bennings drinks from the bottle.) <br/>BENNINGS: Drink up. <br/>(Draysik takes a sip
and coughs.) <br/>BENNINGS: I thought you people could hold your liquor. Your friend
had a few in him the night he killed Clay Stanton. <br/>
DRAYSIK: He didn't drink. <br/>
BENNINGS: Beg your pardon? <br/>
DRAYSIK: I'd better get back to work. <br/>
BENNINGS: Oh, no, wait a minute. I don't think I heard you right.
You're telling me that a sober Skag had the nerve to shoot a man? I
find that hard to believe. Maybe you could demonstrate. <br/>(Bennings cocks his
pistol and puts it on table, grip towards the boy.) <br/>BENNINGS: Pick it up, shoot me
right here between the eyes. This is your golden opportunity, don't
pass it up. <br/>(The tables behind him clear rapidly.) <br/>BENNINGS: I know you'd like to kill
me. That's what all you Skags want, isn't it? Go ahead, or maybe you
need to finish that drink first. <br/>
ARCHER: Excuse me. Can I get some more coffee before you shoot him? <br/>
(Draysik takes the cup and scuttles away, grateful.) <br/>
BENNINGS: Who the hell are you? <br/>
ARCHER: Name's Archer. <br/>
BENNINGS: Well, Mister Archer, you could learn a thing or two about
manners. <br/>(Bennings picks his gun up again.) <br/>ARCHER: I don't like being interrupted in the
middle of a conversation. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll keep that in mind. <br/>
MACCREADY: Is there a problem here? <br/>
BENNINGS: I was just having a drink with our friend Draysik and this
gentleman decided to butt in. <br/>
MACCREADY: I saw you this morning at the undertakers. What's your
business here? <br/>
ARCHER: Just passing through town. <br/>
MACCREADY: This Skag a friend of yours? <br/>
ARCHER: I just wanted him to get me a cup of coffee. <br/>
MACCREADY: It's a little hot for coffee, don't you think? <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe you're right. (to Bennings) It's been a pleasure.
<br/>(Archer leaves.) <br/>
MACCREADY: Keep an eye on him. Make sure he leaves town. And Bennings,
leave the Skag alone. </font></p>

I'd estimate this vessel has been here for at least two centuries. <br/>

ARCHER: My name's Jonathan Archer. I saw you this morning, paying for
that man's casket. <br/>
BETHANY: I don't know where you're from, Mister Archer, but around here
no one refers to a Skagaran as a man. If you'll excuse me. <br/>
ARCHER: Can I help you with that? <br/>
BETHANY: I'll manage. <br/>
ARCHER: It's no trouble. <br/>
BETHANY: I'll ask you again. What do you want? <br/>
ARCHER: I'd like to learn more about the Skagarans. <br/>
BETHANY: Everyone knows about the Skagarans. <br/>
ARCHER: There aren't any where I come from. <br/>
BETHANY: Where's that? <br/>
ARCHER: Up north, quite a ways. <br/>
BETHANY: If certain people had their ways there wouldn't be any around
here either. I heard about what you did in the saloon today. Deputy
Bennings has a nasty temper. Why would your risk getting thrown in
jail, maybe worse? <br/>
ARCHER: I don't think that Skagaran's life is any less valuable than
mine. <br/>
BETHANY: So, what do you want with me?<br/>
ARCHER: Well, you are the teacher around here, aren't you? The first
Skagaran I ever saw was today, lying in that coffin. Seems I'd be more
likely to get the truth from you than from the men who put him there. <br/>
BETHANY: Would you like to meet more of them? <br/>

her two horse buggy, watched by Bennings and his henchmen.) </font></p>

ARCHER: Bethany, these are the friends I told you about. <br/>
BETHANY: You're from up north too? <br/>
T'POL: That's correct. <br/>
BETHANY: The children will be here soon. You said you wanted to learn
something, Mister Archer. You're welcome to stay for the lesson. <br/>
ARCHER: Thanks. <br/>
TUCKER: Kinda late at night to be teaching school. <br/>
BETHANY: It's illegal to teach Skagarans.<br/>

TUCKER: You're not coming with us? <br/>
ARCHER: Don't want to miss my first day at school. <br/>(Later -)<br/>
BETHANY: Nine times twelve, don't forget to carry the one. Yral?<br/>
YRAL: (a boy) Nine times twelve equals one hundred and eight. <br/>
BETHANY: That's right. You're doing very well with your multiplication
tables. Tomorrow night we'll start with something a little more
challenging. Long division. Kret, collect the slates, please. I've
brought a friend with me who'd like to learn more about your people.
Who can tell Mister Archer how the humans and the Skagarans came to
live together? Taliyah? <br/>
TALIYAH: (a girl) Our ancestors took the humans from their planet and
brought them here. <br/>
BETHANY: And why did they do that? <br/>
TALIYAH: To make them work. <br/>
BETHANY: But the humans didn't want to work for the Skagarans, did
they. <br/>
BENNINGS: No, we didn't. <br/>
BETHANY: (to the children) Go on home now. Go on, it's all right. <br/>(The children
flee.) <br/>
BENNINGS: I tried to warn you, Bethany. Teaching Skags is a crime. You
know that. <br/>
BETHANY: Nobody's being hurt here. <br/>
BENNINGS: So you say, but I'm afraid the law is the law. <br/>
ARCHER: I thought you could bend the local ordnances. <br/>

ARCHER: Thanks. What's going to happen to you know. <br/>
BETHANY: Don't worry. This isn't the first time the Sheriff and I
haven't seen eye to eye. <br/>
ARCHER: You didn't get to finish your lesson. I'd like to hear the rest
of it. <br/>
BETHANY: You know the story. Everyone does. <br/>
ARCHER: Everyone seems to have their own version. I'm curious to hear
the way you teach it to the Skagarans. That wreck at their settlement,
was that their ship? <br/>
BETHANY: They used it three hundred years ago to go to Earth and bring
our ancestors back here. They were building colonies, they needed
workers. <br/>
ARCHER: You mean slaves. <br/>
BETHANY: It was a terrible crime. <br/>
ARCHER: Tell me about Cooper Smith. <br/>
BETHANY: That's where the stories differ somewhat. To the humans he's a
folk hero, our liberator. I'm sure that's what you were taught. But the
Skagarans, they call him rakh'tar. It means butcher. He and his men
burned the Skagaran ship, destroyed their weapons. They murdered most
of them. Entire families. Have you heard that version? Smith wrote the
first laws that kept the Skagarans from going to school, owning
property, even marrying. <br/>
ARCHER: So they could never enslave the humans again. <br/>
BETHANY: That's how they justified it. Men like Bennings are happy to
carry on the tradition. </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(Bennings opens the cell door.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">

MACCREADY: You sure? There ain't nothing like a barber shave to make a
man feel civilised. <br/>
ARCHER: I feel civilised enough. <br/>
MACCREADY: Suit yourself. Thanks Henry. <br/>
BARBER: Any time, Sheriff. <br/>(The barber leaves them.)<br/>
MACCREADY: Have a seat. Skagaran whisky. It's illegal, but I've let
Henry keep a bottle around for pulling teeth. <br/>(He pours two shots.) <br/>MACCREADY: Packs a
hell of a wallop. (he drinks) I thought you were heading south to raise
bluehorns. <br/>
ARCHER: That's the plan. <br/>
MACCREADY: Then maybe you can tell me why you were out in Skagtown in
the middle of the night. <br/>
ARCHER: That a crime? <br/>
MACCREADY: My deputy says you and Miss Bethany were teaching those
children. That's a crime. <br/>
ARCHER: But if I decided to lynch a Skagaran, that'd be legal? <br/>
MACCREADY: The law was laid down a long time ago to protect men like
you and me. <br/>
ARCHER: Protect us from what? Children? <br/>
MACCREADY: You really want those children to learn how to read, how to
do their numbers, and then maybe they can learn about how they used to
be in charge around here. How they had guns that could kill a man with
a beam of light, and the human beings were nothing but their labour
force, their property. Is that what you want those children to learn,
Mister Archer? <br/>
ARCHER: You're judging them on something that happened over two hundred
years ago. <br/>
MACCREADY: And it's my job to make sure it never happens again. Now,
I'm not saying it's fair. It's just the way it's always been. I expect
you to be out of town in an hour. <br/>

Office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
MACCREADY: And you were born there? <br/>
ARCHER: I was born in up-state New York. Spent most of my adult life in
San Francisco, though. You've heard of San Francisco?<br/>
MACCREADY: Pacific coast. Why didn't you tell us who you were? <br/>
ARCHER: I wasn't sure how you'd react. We thought we'd better get the
lay of the land first.<br/>
MACCREADY: Well, I can't say I blame you. A part of me never believed
Earth even existed. I thought it was something people made up because
they couldn't stand living here. You taking us back?<br/>
ARCHER: We can't, not right now. Anyway, our ship isn't big enough.
Someday we'll come back for you. You, you realise it's not the same
world your ancestor's left. A lot's changed in three hundred years. <br/>
MACCREADY: You're telling me. <br/>
ARCHER: We've moved past things like intolerance, prejudice. <br/>
MACCREADY: The Skagarans abducted my ancestors, Captain. Turned them
into slaves. <br/>
ARCHER: That was a long time ago.<br/>
MACCREADY: Well, we tend to have a long memory when it comes to that
sort of thing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Main
Street]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> REED:
The Captain's been in there quite a while. <br/>
T'POL: I imagine the Sheriff has a lot of questions. <br/>
REED: Yeah. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sheriff's
Office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
MACCREADY: We did what we had to do. <br/>
ARCHER: I understand, but if you do make it back to Earth you're going
to have to leave all that behind. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Main
Street]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
(Finally Archer and MacCready come out, and walk through the little
crowd that has gathered near the pod.) <br/>
MACCREADY: It's all right. These folks aren't going to hurt anybody. <br/>
ARCHER: This is my First Officer, T'Pol. She's from a planet called
Vulcan. <br/>
T'POL: Pleased to meet you. <br/>
MACCREADY: Ma'am. <br/>
T'POL: Doctor Phlox reports that his patient is doing much better. <br/>
ARCHER: Good. I thought we'd bring Mister MacCready <br/>(There is a gunshot.
MacCready is hit, and the crowd scatters.)<br/>
BENNINGS: Have your men drop those guns.<br/>
ARCHER: Let's talk this through, Bennings.<br/>
BENNINGS: I never was one for talking. <br/>
(His men take up crossfire positions as Reed and the MACOs take up
defensive ones, but Archer stays firm.)<br/>
ARCHER: Trust me, you don't want to pick a fight with us, Deputy.<br/>
BENNINGS: Should have thought of that when you threw in with the Skags.<br/>
ARCHER: We're not taking sides here.<br/>
BENNINGS: Then where'd you get that machine and those weapons?<br/>
MACCREADY: These people are from Earth, Bennings.<br/>
BENNINGS: Earth? You're lying.<br/>
ARCHER: I can prove it to you. Just give me a chance.<br/>
(Reed stuns a sniper in a window, who rolls gently down the roof to the
ground, and the shooting starts. Archer and T'Pol get MacCready to
safety behind the shuttlepod while Reed takes his position behind the
water trough. Cole uses her better rifle sights to take out another
sniper while the Starfleet phasers hit nothing.) <br/>
ARCHER: Lay down some fire. <br/>(He makes a dash towards Bennings, taking
out one henchman the ordinary way and another by cutting into the
balcony he was standing on. Then he gets hit in the right shoulder.
Bennings follows Archer into the livery stables where they have a fist
fight while the MACOs finish off more of the opposition. </font><font face="Arial" size="2">A cowboy holds T'Pol as a shield.) </font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2">
COWBOY: Stay back. I'll kill her. <br/>(Reed
stuns T'Pol  and the cowboy drops her, astonished. Then he gets stunned
too. )<br/>
REED: (to Cole) Secure the area. (to Woods) Find the Captain. <br/>
(The fight in the livery stable crashes into an occupied stall, and
between the unhappy horses legs. Bennings grabs a bale hook and starts
swinging it. He gets it stuck in the timber and Archer finally takes
him down.) </font></p>

(Bethany is gazing out of the large window.) <br/>
ARCHER: We're up too high to see it but your town is down there,
towards the right edge of that mountain range. How are you feeling?<br/>
BETHANY: I feel fine. Not even a scar. <br/>
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox does excellent work. <br/>
BETHANY: You must think we're barbaric. All the things humanity's
accomplished, building ships like this, travelling to other world, and
we're still down there shooting each other. <br/>
ARCHER: The progress on Earth, it didn't happen overnight. <br/>
BETHANY: But it was progress all the same. You've managed to change, we
haven't. Even if you could take us back, I don't think we're ready.<br/>
ARCHER: It may be a while before we're able to start sending ships
here. My guess is, by the time they arrive they'll find things have
changed. <br/>
BETHANY: I think you're giving us too much credit.<br/>
ARCHER: It's happening already. I spoke with MacCready. He agrees that,
in light of recent events some of your laws might be a little outdated.

teaching a mixed class of human and Skagaran children for the first
time, and she has a PADD in her hands. MacCready is standing in the
doorway.) <br/>
BETHANY: Before people could travel through space to other planets,
they had to get off the ground first. Almost forty years after my human
ancestors left Earth, two brothers from Ohio became the first human
beings to build a successful flying machine. Their names were Orville
and Wilbur Wright. Would anyone like to see a picture of their
airplane? You all would. Well, here it is, right here, and you can see
here's Orville Wright, and his brother Wilbur is flying the plane. Now
this is the machine that actually made </font> </p>
