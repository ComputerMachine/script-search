<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <i>ARCHER: There's been an attack on Earth. We've been recalled. <br/>
FUTURE MAN: (to Archer) The probe was sent by the Xindi. They learned
that their world would be destroyed by humans in four hundred years. <br/>
REED [Florida]: Is there going to be some kind of service? <br/>
TUCKER: My sister wasn't big on memorials. <br/>
TUCKER [Corridor]: She was no more important than any of them. <br/>
REED: She was more important to you. There's nothing wrong with
admitting that. <br/>
SOVAL [storage area]: Are you suggesting this is a Xindi? <br/>
ARCHER: (examining remains) I'd sure as hell like to find out. <br/>
SOVAL [outside Starfleet]: You're to return to Vulcan. <br/>
T'POL: I believe that should be my decision. <br/>
SOVAL [Forrest's office]: (monitor scenes of Vulcans attacking each other) We received a
distress call. Every crewman had been anatomically inverted. Their
bodies splayed open, and they were still alive. <br/>
T'POL [Ready room]: I want to remain aboard Enterprise. I've decided to resign my
commission. <br/>
FORREST [Shuttlepod]: (Enterprise in spacedock) Do you think you'll be comfortable
with military on board? <br/>
ARCHER: I don't have a problem with non-Starfleet personnel. I'm going
to need all the muscle I can get when we cross into the Expanse. <br/>
TUCKER [Mess hall]: I can't wait to get in there, Captain, to find the people who
did this. And tell me we won't be tip-toeing around. None of that
non-interference crap T'Pol's always shoving down our throats. <br/>
ARCHER: We'll do what we have to, Trip.</i>

HUMANOID: It could simply be a coincidence. <br/>
REPTILIAN: You're being naive. Their planet is fifty light years away.
It is not a coincidence. <br/>
HUMANOID: How do you know your contacts gave you accurate information? <br/>
INSECTOID: It's the beginning of an invasion. Hundreds of Earth ships
will follow. <br/>
HUMANOID: They have no way of knowing that we launched the probe. <br/>
INSECTOID: We must destroy the vessel. <br/>
REPTILIAN: How many humans are aboard? <br/>
INSECTOID: It doesn't matter. They must be destroyed before they find
the weapon. <br/>
ARBOREAL: When will it be ready? <br/>
DEGRA: The next series of tests is being prepared. <br/>
REPTILIAN: You will accomplish nothing if all you do is run tests. <br/>
ARBOREAL: We must be patient. We must follow the plan that we all
agreed to. <br/>
AQUATIC: Our future is at stake. This council mustn't be divided. <br/>

vessel. </font></p>

How long till we get there? <br/>
T'POL: Another three hours. <br/>
REED: Did the freighter captain say who we were supposed to contact? <br/>
ARCHER: The foreman of the north mine. He's expecting us. <br/>
T'POL: What makes this captain so certain that the miner's is Xindi? <br/>
ARCHER: He's not. He just said he thinks there was a Xindi aboard a
transport he took there a few years ago. <br/>
REED: And it is safe to enter orbit? There are no security
considerations? <br/>
ARCHER: He didn't mention any. <br/>
REED: With all due respect, sir, we should approach with caution. The
freighter captain was of questionable character. <br/>
ARCHER: Where are we, Malcolm? <br/>
REED: Sir? <br/>
ARCHER: This room. What did it used to be? <br/>
REED: A storage bay, sir. Conduit housings, I believe. <br/>
ARCHER: But it got retrofitted. Starfleet went to a lot of trouble to
turn it into our new Command centre. Why is that, Malcolm? <br/>
REED: Because of our mission, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: To find the Xindi, right? <br/>
REED: Right. <br/>
ARCHER: So this state of the art equipment was put in here to help us
gather all the pieces of the puzzle, figure out who's trying to destroy
Earth. <br/>
REED: Right. <br/>
ARCHER: Six weeks. We've been in this Expanse for six weeks. What data
have we gathered? What pieces of the puzzle have we started to put
together? Not a single one. We don't have the luxury of being safe or
cautious any more, and if the only lead we can find comes from a
freighter captain of questionable character, then that's good enough
for me. Understood? (leaves) <br/>
REED: Understood. </font></p>

Ensign. I'm Major Hayes, this is Sergeant Kemper, Corporals Romero and
Chang. <br/>
HOSHI: Military Assault Command. <br/>
HAYES: Captain Archer wanted the best. <br/>
HOSHI: You seem to have all gotten your space legs. <br/>
KEMPER: Some of us are still visiting Doctor Phlox every morning. <br/>
ROMERO: The wonders of modern medicine. <br/>
HOSHI: What do you think of our doctor, Sergeant? I imagine you don't
run into many Denobulans in Duluth, Minnesota. <br/>
KEMPER: Actually, I'm stationed outside of Atlanta. No Denobulans, but
we have our fair share of alien visitors. You must have gone pretty
deep into our records. I haven't lived in Duluth since junior high
school. <br/>
HOSHI: You may have left Duluth, but you've still got plenty of Duluth
left in your inflections. <br/>
KEMPER: Excuse me? <br/>
HAYES: Ensign Sato's a linguist, Kemper. You give her enough time, she
could probably tell you what street you grew up on. <br/>
CHANG: Do you have any idea where we're headed, Ensign? <br/>
HOSHI: I'm sure Captain Archer will let us know when he has reason to. <br/>
HAYES: Let's hope it's soon. The quicker you folks find these Xindi,
the quicker we can get to work. We have a briefing in a few minutes. If
you'll excuse you. </font></p>

TUCKER: About ten minutes ago. Ensign McFarlane got pretty banged up
but he's going to be okay. <br/>

look at this. The pigmentation is far more colourful that I would have
suspected. <br/>
T'POL: What are we looking at? <br/>
PHLOX: Xindi epithelial cells, harvested from the corpse they found
inside the crashed probe. <br/>
T'POL: It looks more like scales. <br/>
PHLOX: Precisely. When I'm finished constructing my physiometric
profile I wouldn't be surprised to find he has reptilian
characteristics. <br/>
T'POL: You wanted to see me. <br/>
PHLOX: Do you have any siblings? <br/>
T'POL: No. <br/>
PHLOX: Commander Tucker had one sister. She was killed in the attack. <br/>
T'POL: I'm aware of that. <br/>
PHLOX: He's having difficulty dealing with the loss. <br/>
T'POL: It's to be expected. <br/>
PHLOX: More specifically, it's affecting his sleep. I've been giving
him sedatives, but I'd like to see him start tapering off. <br/>
T'POL: I'm not sure I understand. <br/>
PHLOX: I believe the Commander would be a fine candidate for Vulcan
neuro-pressure. <br/>
T'POL: I doubt the Commander would have the patience to sit in one
place long enough to get through the first posture. <br/>
PHLOX: I'm certain with your delicate guidance <br/>
T'POL: Delicate is not a word I associate with Mister Tucker. The
instruction of neuro-pressure is a very intimate act. <br/>
PHLOX: And he's suffered a very intimate loss. He needs your help. <br/>
T'POL: Have him come to my quarters. <br/>
PHLOX: There's one little problem. Assuming that you'd agree to my
request, I suggested all of this to Commander Tucker earlier today, and
he was less than enthusiastic. <br/>
T'POL: I don't understand. <br/>
PHLOX: Perhaps if I could get him to go to your quarters, you might be
able to convince him of the lasting benefits of Vulcan neuro-pressure. </font></p>

ARCHER: I'm Jonathan Archer. This is Lieutenant Reed. <br/>
FOREMAN: I've been told you might be able to make it worth my while if
I were to arrange a certain introduction. <br/>
ARCHER: Depends what you mean by worth your while. <br/>
FOREMAN: I've always had a fondness for platinum, specifically in its
liquified state. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm afraid we don't carry precious metals on board. <br/>
FOREMAN: Pity. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sure there's something else we could offer you. <br/>
FOREMAN: (takes a gulp from his breather) I don't make a habit of
allowing people to interrupt my workers, Xindi or otherwise. <br/>
ARCHER: (quietly, to Reed) What about the antimatter relays? <br/>
REED: Their linings are coated with a platinum-cobalt alloy. Trip could
probably strip them down and separate the metals. <br/>
ARCHER: How much platinum are we talking about? <br/>
FOREMAN: Well, I'm a reasonable man. I'm sure you could part with, say,
half a litre. <br/>
ARCHER: I'd need to see this man, scan him, confirm that he's Xindi. <br/>
FOREMAN: That won't be necessary. <br/>
(He tosses a cloth to Archer, who opens it to see a severed finger.) <br/>

ARCHER: Is it Xindi? <br/>
PHLOX: Yes, and no. <br/>
ARCHER: I need something a little more concrete, Doctor. <br/>
PHLOX: The genetic profile is nearly identical to the tissue samples
taken from the corpse found on Earth. Their base pair sequencing is far
closer than, say, humans and chimpanzees. Nearly identical, but not
quite. <br/>
ARCHER: Like humans and Neanderthals? <br/>
PHLOX: A reasonable analogy. After analysing the remains of the Xindi
corpse I was able to provide the computer with enough data to create
this rendering. However, this humanoid is reptilian, that finger is
not. It's covered with skin, not unlike yours or mine, but it's Xindi
all the same. I wish I could be more helpful, Captain. <br/>
TUCKER: (enters) Sir. <br/>
ARCHER: How's it coming? <br/>
TUCKER: We're going to end up stripping more than two hundred relays to
get half a litre of liquified platinum, but you'll have it by this
afternoon. <br/>

pay you. <br/>

provide me with that, stop wasting my time. <br/>

particularly care, but we didn't come here to stage a prison break so
why don't you just give us the co-ordinates and we'll all stop wasting
each other's kind. <br/>

life. <br/>
T'POL: Lieutenant? <br/>
REED: That had nothing to do with who knows Enterprise inside and out.
It had to do with who the Major thinks is more capable of carrying out
this rescue. </font></p>

They're gone, all three of them. <br/>
FOREMAN: That's impossible. <br/>

If this leads to the surface why didn't you use it before? <br/>
KESSICK: The residue in the atmosphere is at least thirty times more
toxic than it is down here. This is the first time I've had the luxury
of a ship waiting for me. </font></p>

The lower levels are hyper-saturated with ionised particles, so you'll
have to get within a hundred metres to pick up their biosigns. <br/>

FOREMAN: Duct thirteen. They've opened two emergency baffles. <br/>
GUARD: They're nearly to the surface. We should destroy their landing
pod. <br/>
FOREMAN: No, too valuable. How long would it take to redirect the
plasma flow into that conduit? <br/>

KESSICK: You've risked your lives to learn where my homeworld is,
because you say you have important business with my people? Which
species? Have you ever even met a Xindi before today? <br/>
ARCHER: One, and he didn't look very much like you. <br/>
KESSICK: Not all of them do. There are five distinct species of Xindi,
and five distinct opinions on which one is dominant. <br/>
(Something clangs in the duct.) <br/>
TUCKER: What was that? </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>
(Another clang.) </font><br/>
<font face="Arial" size="2"> ARCHER: That
sounded an awful lot like those emergency baffles we opened. <br/>
TUCKER: Why would they open the rest? They'll just help us escape <br/>
ARCHER: I thought you said this duct isn't used anymore. <br/>
KESSICK: It isn't. They've obviously re-routed the plasma. <br/>
ARCHER: How far up to the next maintenance hatch? How far? <br/>
KESSICK: I don't know. <br/>
TUCKER: I think the safest bet is to head back down to the last one. <br/>
ARCHER: I think you're right. <br/>
KESSICK: That's where the plasma's coming from! We should go up. <br/>
ARCHER: Suit yourself. <br/>

KESSICK: It's too late. We'll be killed. <br/>
TUCKER: Shut up. Just shut up. <br/>

TUCKER: You stupid son of a bitch. I ought to open this hatch and throw
you down into <br/>

KESSICK: They forced me to come with them. They said they'd kill me if
I didn't. Just now, this one, he tried to throw me into the plasma.
Said they didn't need me any more. Thank you, thank you. If you hadn't
been waiting here I don't know what I <br/>

additions to my workforce, but you've turned out to be more trouble
than you're worth. Select a detail. Take them to the surface. Shoot all
three of them. <br/>
(Rnter the MACOs, sliding down ropes and shooting. There's a tussle as
Archer and Tucker get guns from prone guards and join in the battle.
Kessick crawls away and hides under the stairs.) <br/>
ARCHER: You okay? <br/>
KEMPER: Yes, sir. <br/>
(Corporal Cole gives a masterclass in using nightstick to disarm and
render an assailant helpless.) <br/>

ARCHER: You had your chance. <br/>

(There's weapons fire coming from the dark. Kessick is shot in the
back.) <br/>
HAYES: Fayette, go. <br/>

eyes. The second shuttlepod appears out of the gloom.) <br/>

warp. </font></p>

Captain's Starlog, supplemental. The three alien warships followed
Enterprise for nearly an hour, but couldn't keep up with us. I guess
they'll have to look elsewhere for new additions to their labour force.

Come in. <br/>
PHLOX: I'm terribly sorry, Captain, but there was nothing I could do. I
realise how important it would have been to have a Xindi to help us. <br/>
ARCHER: He wasn't a particularly helpful Xindi, Doctor. <br/>
PHLOX: You'd be surprised. It was extremely difficult and painful for
him to speak, but he managed to dictate this to me before he died. He
said you'd know what it meant. <br/>

REED: The Doctor's got them back in their quarters already. <br/>
TUCKER: You've got to admit, their team did a pretty impressive job
down there. Nothing your guys couldn't have done just as well. <br/>

PHLOX: If you wouldn't mind, Commander. I promised T'Pol I'd take these
bioscans to her quarters, but I still have quite a bit of work to do
here. <br/>

PHLOX: Sickbay to T'Pol. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: Yes, Doctor. <br/>
PHLOX: Commander Tucker is on his way to your quarters. He believes I
just gave him a sedative, but it was only a placebo. He's had a rather
difficult day. I believe you have your work cut out for you. </font></p>

Sorry to drop by so late, but Phlox said you were expecting this. <br/>

still have a few more showers to take before I get all this trellium-D
off me. <br/>
T'POL: Would you like a cup of tea? <br/>
TUCKER: Thanks, but it might keep me up. The Doctor just gave me a
sedative. <br/>
T'POL: You are having trouble sleeping as well. <br/>
TUCKER: I never would have pegged you for an insomniac. <br/>
T'POL: I believe the Expanse has been disrupting my REM patterns. <br/>
TUCKER: Probably nothing a good hypospray couldn't cure. <br/>
T'POL: Vulcan science teaches us to prompt our bodies to create their
own medicines. <br/>
TUCKER: So why are you still having trouble sleeping? <br/>
T'POL: The neural nodes that need to be stimulated are difficult to
reach. Perhaps you could help me. <br/>

meet in the middle.) <br/>

T'POL: A little closer together. Harder. Harder. <br/>
TUCKER: If I push any harder I'll knock you over. <br/>
T'POL: Just like that. Please continue. Ahhh. That was far more
effective than a hypospray. </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>

<font face="Arial" size="2"> TUCKER: Glad to
be of assistance. <br/>
T'POL: It would be only fair for me to return the favour. Please,
disrobe. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm really flattered, Sub-Commander, and don't think under
different circumstances I wouldn't jump at the chance <br/>
T'POL: Are you implying I'm making sexual advances? <br/>
TUCKER: No. No, no, no, not at all. I, I was just. You see, the Doctor
gave me this sedative and I think it's starting to work. <br/>
T'POL: The Doctor injected you with a placebo. He sent you here because
he wanted me to persuade you to try Vulcan neuro-pressure. As I
predicted, it was a pointless exercise. <br/>
TUCKER: Why didn't he just ask me? <br/>
T'POL: He did. You refused. <br/>
TUCKER: Oh, so this whole thing was just a set up. <br/>
T'POL: The Doctor knows how intransigent you can be. <br/>
TUCKER: Intransigent! <br/>
T'POL: Unwilling to compromise. <br/>
TUCKER: I know what it means, but it just so happens it's not true. I'm
as willing to compromise as anyone else. <br/>

they approached Earth.) <br/>
TRAVIS: Sir, we're approaching the coordinates. <br/>
ARCHER: Tactical Alert. Stand by weapons. Any indications that we're
being scanned? <br/>
REED: No, sir. No vessels, no signs of technology, nothing. <br/>
ARCHER: How many inhabited planets? <br/>
T'POL: I'm not detecting any planets, inhabited or otherwise. <br/>
ARCHER: Son of a bitch lied to us. <br/>
TUCKER: Phlox said the Xindi used his dying breath to give us these
coordinates. Why would he lie? <br/>
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm picking up a debris field. <br/>
ARCHER: A ship? <br/>
TRAVIS: It's a lot bigger than that. <br/>
ARCHER: Put it up. <br/>
T'POL: It's nearly eighty million kilometres long. It was a planet. <br/>
ARCHER: Move us in closer. <br/>
(They fly in amongst the lumps of rock.) <br/>
ARCHER: How long ago did this happen? <br/>
T'POL: Judging by the field dispersion, approximately one hundred and
twenty years. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm pretty sure there was a population here, Captain. I'm
picking up refined metals and traces of alloys. Some of them match the
hull of the Xindi probe. <br/>
ARCHER: They're building a weapon, planning to annihilate Earth because
they think we're going to destroy their world in four hundred years.
How is that possible if their world doesn't exist anymore, hasn't
existed for decades. <br/>
T'POL: We know the probe that attacked Earth was built somewhere in
this Expanse, and it was built recently. It's logical to assume the new
weapon is being developed at the same location. <br/>
TUCKER: But, if it's not here <br/>
ARCHER: Prepare to go to warp four. <br/>
TRAVIS: What course, sir? <br/>
ARCHER: Deeper into the Expanse. <br/>

distortions. <br/>

REPTILIAN: Toward the Orassin distortion fields. <br/>
ARBOREAL: Then it's unlikely they'll survive. <br/>
INSECTOID: We can't assume that. I'm sending vessels to destroy them. <br/>
DEGRA: If they are the first wave of an invasion it would be best for
us to remain hidden. Let them keep searching. <br/>
AQUATIC: He's correct. They won't find what they're looking for. <br/>
INSECTOID: Finish the weapon quickly, or I'll destroy the Earth ship
whether this Council approves or not. </font> </p>
