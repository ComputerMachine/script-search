Captain's Starlog, December 27, 2154. We're on course for the
Berengarius system, a potential site for the first in a series of
proposed Starbases. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">T'POL: A Vulcan science vessel surveyed the seventh
planet over fifty years ago. The file states it's an M class world with
a flourishing ecosystem. No intelligent life. <br/>
ARCHER: Sounds promising. <br/>
T'POL: They did report one distinctive feature which bears mentioning. <br/>
ARCHER: And that is? <br/>
T'POL: A species of flying reptile, some reportedly over two hundred
metres long. They're also said to breathe fire. There's been lingering
questions over the accuracy of this report. <br/>
ARCHER: Can't wait to find out. <br/>
REED: There's a ship. It's on an intercept course. <br/>
T'POL: I don't recognise the configuration. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's see it. <br/>
(A rounded, green ship is on the viewscreen.) <br/>
REED: Doesn't look very friendly. <br/>
ARCHER: Tactical Alert. Let's see what they want, Hoshi. <br/>
HOSHI: They're responding. <br/>
(The caller is green, wearing leather and with bits of metal on his
head.) <br/>
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: Captain Archer. <br/>
ARCHER: And you are? <br/>
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: Harrad-Sar. Deactivate your weapon systems
immediately, or I'll be forced to open fire. (pause for opening
sequence) You're still targeting my ship. <br/>
ARCHER: And you're targeting mine. It seems we're at an impasse. <br/>
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: Not for long. <br/>
ARCHER: Instead of sitting here pointing guns at each other, why don't
we deactivate our weapons together? <br/>
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: Very well. (snaps fingers) <br/>
ARCHER: Now, what can we do for you? <br/>
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: I have a proposal to make. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm listening. <br/>
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: I prefer to discuss business in person. You're
invited aboard my ship. <br/>
ARCHER: We've dealt with your people before. The experience wasn't one
I care to repeat. If you can give me some idea what this is about? <br/>
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: What I have to say could smooth relations
between your Starfleet and the Orion Syndicate. My hospitality is
renowned, Captain. I don't offer it to everyone. And once I have been
refused, I never offer it again. </font></p>

into slaves. Let's at least ask him to come here. <br/>
ARCHER: I have a feeling he'd see it as an insult. <br/>
REED: I can live with that. <br/>
ARCHER: Any chance to improve relations with the Syndicate, I'm willing
to take that risk. Anything to have one less hostile species out there.

involve me. <br/>

Captain. <br/>

ARCHER: With all those people after me, I need to stay quick on my
feet. <br/>
HARRAD: Yes. <br/>
ARCHER: You said you had something important to discuss with us. <br/>
HARRAD: Well, it's poor custom to discuss business before
entertainment. If the food didn't arouse your hunger, this should. <br/>

proceed to dance for the Starfleet men.) <br/>
HARRAD: What do you think? <br/>

ARCHER: I'd have to agree with my tactical officer. <br/>
HARRAD: I think she likes you. <br/>(He means the one in the red bra.) <br/>HARRAD: Her name is
Navaar. She's the most experienced of the three. They're sisters. I
purchased them at a trading post you once visited. Incredible, aren't
they? They can make you forget most of your troubles. Of course,
creatures such as these come with troubles of their own. But women are
the same throughout the galaxy, aren't they? <br/>

large deposits of magnesite. Enough to build a thousand warp reactors.
And that's just what his scanners could detect. He's offering to give
us the coordinates. <br/>
T'POL: Why would he divulge this information? <br/>
ARCHER: He doesn't have the infrastructure to get the magnesite out of
the ground. <br/>
T'POL: So he wants Starfleet to construct mining facilities. <br/>
ARCHER: And he'll get a ten-percent share. He's also promised to help
establish a dialogue between Starfleet and the Orion Syndicate. <br/>
T'POL: Are you going to accept his offer? <br/>

T'POL: It's more than that. Our guests visited the Mess Hall this
morning. As a result, twelve crewmen reported late for their shifts. <br/>

T'POL: It's primarily their attire. <br/>

assigning them some clothes. <br/>
T'POL: It might also be a good idea if you have a word with them.
They're still under the impression they belong to you. Unless a new

KELBY: He's trying to get rid of me. Don't listen to him! <br/>
ARCHER: Kelby. <br/>
PHLOX: Captain, his adrenaline levels are dangerously high. I need to
administer a sedative. <br/>
ARCHER: Not till I get some answers first. <br/>
PHLOX: In his current state, he can't give you coherent answers. <br/>
KELBY: I just want to go back to Engineering. <br/>
ARCHER: All right. <br/>
KELBY: I just want to go back to Engineering. <br/>
PHLOX: (injecting him) Be quiet! <br/>
TUCKER: What's wrong with him? <br/>
PHLOX: It's the same thing that's affecting everyone on this ship. It's
a highly potent pheromone. When exposed to human males, it accelerates
the metabolism, causing aggression and ultimately a form of delusion. <br/>
TUCKER: The Orions? <br/>
PHLOX: Women aboard the ship have also been affected. I've received an
increasing number of complaints about headaches and listlessness. I
suspect the pheromone acts as a defence mechanism against competition. <br/>
TUCKER: You okay? <br/>
PHLOX: It's impacted my sleep cycle. I'm having to rely on stimulants
to stay awake. <br/>
ARCHER: Doesn't seem to be affecting you. <br/>
PHLOX: I've scanned a good number of the crew. So far, the only people
who haven't been affected are T'Pol and Commander Tucker. <br/>
TUCKER: Why me? <br/>
PHLOX: I would have to run some more tests, but for the rest of us the
effect seems to be cumulative. The longer we're exposed, the more
pronounced the results are.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NAVAAR: So, this is what you meant when you said we
were free to start new lives? <br/>
ARCHER: (holding up a device) We found this in your quarters. <br/>
NAVAAR: It seems we have no privacy either. <br/>
ARCHER: It's a communication device. You've been in contact with
Harrad-Sar as recently as two hours ago. <br/>
NAVAAR: And if I have? <br/>
ARCHER: You were sent here to disable my ship. That was his plan from
the start, wasn't it? <br/>NAVAAR: Harrad-Sar contacted me to see if we've
been treated well. <br/>
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox believes that prolonged exposure to your
pheromones makes men delusional, and extremely vulnerable to
suggestion. That's how you convinced Kelby to sabotage our engines. <br/>
D'NESH: Your crewman acted alone. I had nothing to do with it. <br/>
NAVAAR: It seems the only delusion here is your own. <br/>
ARCHER: Damn it! It's time to start telling me the truth! <br/>
NAVAAR: I'm worried about you, Captain. You don't seem well. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm not the one you should be worried about. <br/>
NAVAAR: I can see you're not very experienced at making threats. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm a lot better at carrying them out. <br/>
NAVAAR: We were a gift, nothing more. A true commander would know how
to appreciate such a gesture. <br/>
ARCHER: Tell me. When's he going to attack us? <br/>
NAVAAR: No one is coming to attack your ship. <br/>
(There's only glass between their faces.) <br/>
NAVAAR: Please release us. <br/>
(She moves towards the door controls, still looking into Archer's eyes,
and he moves with her.) <br/>
T'POL: Captain. <br/>
(The spell is broken as he realises he nearly let them out) <br/>
NAVAAR: I'm obviously not the only woman with power over you. <br/>
(Archer and T'Pol leave, so the women start to work on the MACO
guarding them.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARCHER: Get down to Engineering. Do what you can to
help Trip. <br/>
T'POL: It's better if I stay on the Bridge. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't need you to look after me. <br/>
T'POL: You're not immune to these pheromones. Your judgment is
impaired. <br/>
ARCHER: I can handle it. We need to get the engines back online. I
don't want to be a sitting duck when Harrad-Sar gets here. You have
your orders. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">T'POL: The Captain asked me to offer my assistance.
<br/>
TUCKER: Great. You can run through these diagnostics. See if you can
find anything that isn't fried. You really think they're coming after
us? <br/>
T'POL: It's likely. The transmissions sent by the Orion females suggest
that Harrad-Sar's ship is getting closer. <br/>
TUCKER: You know, I keep thinking back to our first mission, when we
met the Suliban. I was so damn naive. I actually thought it was the
last time we'd have to fight someone. <br/>
CREWMAN: I said leave it alone! <br/>
CREWMAN 2: Get your hands off me! <br/>
TUCKER: Knock if off! That's an order! Start up again, and you'll end
up in the Brig, understand? Now go help Masarro with the injectors.
Now! (to the other crewman) Get back to work. That's the third one in
the last hour. <br/>
T'POL: There have been altercations throughout the ship. The Captain's
been affected. I'm concerned about him. <br/>
TUCKER: The thing I can't figure out is why I'm immune. <br/>
T'POL: That might have something to do with me. <br/>
TUCKER: You? <br/>
T'POL: There's a long-held belief that when a Vulcan mates, there's a
shared psychic bond. <br/>
TUCKER: We didn't mate. Okay, what do you mean by psychic bond? <br/>
T'POL: It's difficult to explain. Feelings, thoughts, even images can
be shared. <br/>
TUCKER: Those daydreams. <br/>
T'POL: What? <br/>
TUCKER: When I said before that I wasn't having any daydreams about
you, it wasn't actually true. So if we're bonded, what does this have
to do with me not being affected by the Orions? <br/>
T'POL: I'm immune to the pheromones because of my Vulcan physiology. <br/>
TUCKER: And you're making me immune? <br/>
T'POL: Apparently. <br/>
TUCKER: I don't know whether to be relieved or really worried. </font></p>

ARCHER: Put him up. <br/>
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: Can I be of help, Captain? Do you need a tow? <br/>
We still have weapons. You're not going to get this ship without one
hell of a fight. <br/>
I'd rather I didn't have to kill you, but if that's what it takes. The
Syndicate wants your head, Captain, and they don't really care whether
or not it's attached to your body. <br/>
(The Orion ship starts firing at Enterprise.) <br/>
REED: He's trying to knock out our weapons. <br/>
ARCHER: Then take out his. <br/>
(Some shots are exchanged, but the Orion gets in more hits than
Enterprise.) <br/>

HARRAD [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid you have an appointment with a pair
of Orion marauders. I don't intend to keep them waiting. <br/>
ARCHER: Release my ship! <br/>
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: I can see you're upset, and I sympathise, but
it's truly out of my hands. We are both slaves to the situation. <br/>
ARCHER: They control you? <br/>
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: You finally realise that. Yes, Captain, you've
been operating under a misconception. It is the men who are the slaves,
not the women. </font></p>

pretty carefully, when he wasn't trying to blow up the ship. <br/>
