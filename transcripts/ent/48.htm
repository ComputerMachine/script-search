(Enterprise is flying close to a massive star.) <br/>
T'POL: It's losing mass at an extraordinary rate. <br/>
REED: How long before it goes supernova? <br/>
T'POL: A hundred years, maybe two. <br/>
ARCHER: Too bad we won't be around. It's going to be one hell of an
explosion. <br/>
T'POL: Speak for yourself. I might very well be around. <br/>
TUCKER: Can't forget Vulcan longevity, Captain. A hundred years from
now? How old would that make you? <br/>
ARCHER: No earth ship has ever been within ten light years of a
hypergiant. How much farther can we move in? <br/>
T'POL: Our hull temperature is approaching eleven hundred degrees. It
would be unsafe to get any closer. <br/>
ARCHER: Then we'll have to run our scans from here. Tell Astrometrics
to get going. I'm sure they're champing at the bit. <br/>
REED: We may not be able to get any closer, but someone else has. <br/>
ARCHER: You found a ship? <br/>
REED: Bearing two six one mark four. They must be at least twenty
thousand kilometres farther in than we are. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's see her. <br/>(A ship comes up on the viewscreen.) <br/>ARCHER: Recognise
it? <br/>
T'POL: No. <br/>
ARCHER: Hail them. <br/>
HOSHI: The interference is pretty heavy, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: Then try audio. This is Captain Archer of the starship
Enterprise. I assume you've detected us. <br/>
DRENNIK [OC]: Captain Drennik. Where have you travelled from? <br/>
ARCHER: The Sol system. And you? <br/>
DRENNIK [OC]: We come from a system called Vissia, more than twenty
five light years from here. We saw you arrive yesterday. I assume
you're here to study the hypergiant. <br/>
ARCHER: My species has never seen one up close. <br/>
DRENNIK [OC]: It is quite a sight. Have you measured its rate of
nucleosynthesis? <br/>
ARCHER: I'm afraid we haven't developed the technology to do that. <br/>
DRENNIK [OC]: If you don't mind eliminating the development stage, I'd
be more than happy to help you modify your sensors. <br/>
ARCHER: Thank you. I'm not sure we have anything to offer you in
return. <br/>
DRENNIK [OC]: You could invite us to visit your ship. Meeting new
species is one of our primary goals. <br/>
ARCHER: It's one of ours as well. We'd be honoured to have you join us
for dinner. <br/>
DRENNIK [OC]: We'll be there within the hour. I look forward to it.

about charging weapons. <br/>

are socialising. Vissians have big spectacle-like bones around the
eyes.) <br/>
DRENNIK: Trinesium can withstand temperatures up to eighteen thousand
degrees. We've been using it to construct our hulls for over a century.
<br/>
ARCHER: You must be able to get down into the photosphere of most
G-type stars. <br/>
DRENNIK: We can get even deeper with our stratopod. It's got twice the
shielding. <br/>
ARCHER: Flying into stars is a long way off for us. <br/>
DRENNIK: Your technology will evolve. What's important is that you're
explorers. <br/>
ARCHER: We have gone farther than any other humans. <br/>
DRENNIK: You might enjoy going even farther. I'm taking the stratopod
into the hydrogen layer tomorrow. I'd be pleased to have you join me. <br/>

This should do it. <br/>
TUCKER: So, you've heard of these cogenitors. <br/>
PHLOX: Not all species are limited to two sexes. In fact, I have it on
good authority that the Rigellians have four, or was it five? <br/>
TUCKER: So you're saying that this man or woman or whatever, is a third
sex? <br/>
PHLOX: That's exactly what I'm saying. <br/>
TUCKER: And she, it, is part of the impregnation process. <br/>
PHLOX: Precisely. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm pretty familiar with how it works with two sexes, but <br/>
PHLOX: Multi-gendered techniques aren't always the same, but in this
case I imagine the cogenitor provides an enzyme which facilitates
conception. <br/>
TUCKER: What do you mean by provides? <br/>
PHLOX: Well, first, the female has to <br/>
TUCKER: No, no, no, don't tell me. I don't think I want to know. <br/>
PHLOX: Oh, well. I have pictures. <br/>
TUCKER: I think I'll pass. So how long is this going to last? I might
want to stay there for a while. <br/>
PHLOX: It should protect you from omicron radiation for about twelve

DRENNIK: There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of
in your philosophy. <br/>
ARCHER: Where'd you hear that? <br/>
DRENNIK: Hamlet, Act One, Scene Five. Your Communications Officer was
kind enough to provide us with some of your literature. I assumed you
approved. <br/>
ARCHER: Absolutely, but I didn't think you'd be quoting it the next
day. <br/>
DRENNIK: We retain most of what we read. <br/>
ARCHER: And you obviously read pretty quickly. <br/>
DRENNIK: After I finished Shakespeare last night, I began reading the
plays of Sophocles. What do you recommend after that? <br/>
ARCHER: Seems like you're picking the good ones all by yourself. That's
got to be ionised hydrogen. <br/>
DRENNIK: It's generating magnetic currents. <br/>
ARCHER: I've got friends back at home who are not going to believe
this. <br/>

ENGINEER: The antimatter stream is compressed before the deuterium's
injected into the core. <br/>
TUCKER: So you don't need magnetic confinement. <br/>
ENGINEER: Let me bring up the schematics. <br/>
TUCKER: Where we come from, Earth, there are only two genders. <br/>
ENGINEER: That's true of most worlds. <br/>
TUCKER: I don't mean to pry but, does every family have a cogenitor? <br/>
ENGINEER: That wouldn't be very efficient. They are only needed when a
couple's trying to have a child. <br/>
TUCKER: And when they're not? <br/>
ENGINEER: The cogenitor is assigned to another couple. They make up
about three percent of our population, which seems to be a perfect
ratio. Nature has a way of finding the right balance. <br/>
TUCKER: Is the one I met the only one on your ship? <br/>
ENGINEER: The only one. Once Calla and I are finished with it, I doubt
it'll be needed before we return home. Would you like to take a closer
look at the plasma converters? <br/>
TUCKER: I would. Thanks. So, does it live with you and your wife? <br/>
ENGINEER: We keep it in our quarters, yes. <br/>
TUCKER: What does it do when you're not <br/>
ENGINEER: It eats, sleeps. There's not much else for it to do. <br/>
TUCKER: What about school? <br/>
ENGINEER: They only serve one purpose. Sending them to school would
make no sense. Why are you so curious about them? <br/>
TUCKER: Humans are very curious. <br/>
ENGINEER: You might find this difficult to believe, but this polymer is
composed of over two hundred naturally occurring elements. <br/>
TUCKER: That's impossible. <br/>
ENGINEER: I read in your database that you've discovered only ninety
two. I understand how this might seem unnerving. <br/>

How long will you be gone? <br/>

kilometres. We'll be scanning surface features that are undetectable from
higher altitudes. <br/>

especially with a person you've just met. <br/>
ARCHER: I think I'll survive. These people are fascinating, T'Pol. They
have a lot to offer us. This could be the beginning of a beautiful

T'POL: Briefly. <br/>
TUCKER: He and his wife are trying to have a baby. <br/>
T'POL: How interesting. <br/>
TUCKER: There was someone else with them. They called her a cogenitor.
You know what that is? <br/>
T'POL: A third gender. Why do you call it her? <br/>
TUCKER: Well, she looks more like a her than a him. They treat her like
a pet, kept in her room, not taught to read or write, no name. Porthos
has a name. <br/>
T'POL: It's not our place to judge the customs of other cultures. <br/>
TUCKER: We're not talking about taking your shoes off when you walk
into someone's house. This cogenitor's treated like one of Phlox's
leeches. You pull it out of its tank when you need it, then you throw
it back in. <br/>
T'POL: Tri-gender reproduction is not uncommon. <br/>
TUCKER: That's not what I'm talking about. This is a question of human
rights. <br/>

It's good advice. Mating habits are often quite personal. Some species

that? <br/>

of Earth were pretty violent. They had a hard time trusting things they

Klaatu. Who he was, where he came from. So, they tried to kill him. <br/>
