TALAS: (a female) We've lost the warp trail. <br/>
SHRAN: Continue scanning. You know what we're looking for, Lieutenant.
It shouldn't be that difficult to find. <br/>
TALAS: Commander. We've been searching for weeks. <br/>
SHRAN: And we'll continue searching until we've accomplished our
mission. <br/>
TALAS: Or until we're destroyed? You've seen what this place is like.
What are the chances they've survived? <br/>
SHRAN: We have our orders. <br/>
TALAS: We should head back to Andoria while we're still able. <br/>
SHRAN: You sound like you're afraid of this Expanse, Lieutenant. I'd
expect that from a Vulcan, not a member of the Imperial Guard. <br/>
TALAS: Continue scanning. <br/>

out there. </font></p>

HUMANOID: Delayed. <br/>
DEGRA: I said the matter was urgent. <br/>
REPTILIAN: Typical humanoid arrogance. You expect us to come scurrying
whenever it suits you. <br/>
DEGRA: I'm sorry to inconvenience you, but I'm sure you'll find the
journey worth the effort. <br/>
ARBOREAL: The weapon is ready? <br/>
DEGRA: Not quite. <br/>
REPTILIAN: Then why are you wasting our time? <br/>
DEGRA: The new prototype has been completed. We've scheduled a test. <br/>
REPTILIAN: When? <br/>
DEGRA: Three days. You'll be able to view the test remotely from this
chamber. If everything goes as planned, we should be ready to deploy
the final version in a month, maybe sooner. <br/>
HUMANOID: And the human threat will finally be eliminated. <br/>

it was there at first. <br/>
ARCHER: But you are now. <br/>
HOSHI: Yes, sir. The isotopic signature matches the kemocite that you
planted on the Xindi ship. <br/>
ARCHER: Set a course. Tell Trip I want everything he can give me from
the engines. <br/>
T'POL: Captain, as you know, Ensign Sato and I have been working to
reconstruct our database. <br/>
ARCHER: And? <br/>
HOSHI: We've managed to dig about thirty percent of our lost data out
of the redundant memory core. <br/>
T'POL: Enough to begin piecing together a map of the spatial anomalies.
The signal lies just beyond a dense field of them. <br/>
HOSHI: Here. <br/>
ARCHER: How long to go around it? <br/>
T'POL: A field this massive? Seventeen days at warp five. <br/>

ARCHER: Acknowledged. T'Pol? <br/>
T'POL: I've charted the largest anomalies, but the field is extremely
dense. We may not be able to avoid all of them. <br/>
ARCHER: Do your best. Travis, take us in. One half impulse. <br/>
TRAVIS: Aye, sir. <br/>
T'POL: Come to bearing two seven five mark eight. Hard to port! <br/>
REED: We just grazed it. No damage. <br/>
ARCHER: Just how accurate is this map of yours? <br/>
T'POL: Considering I only have thirty percent of our database to work
with. There's an anomaly forming directly ahead. It's expanding. <br/>
ARCHER: Expanding? <br/>
T'POL: I've never seen this before. They're merging, building on one
another. <br/>
TRAVIS: Which way, Sub-Commander? <br/>
T'POL: It's growing too rapidly. <br/>
ARCHER: Emergency power to hull plating. Brace for impact. <br/>
(A big green nasty passes all the way through the ship, causing bangs
and injuries.)<br/>
REED: We're losing hull integrity. Atmosphere's venting on D deck. <br/>
ARCHER: Come about. Get us out of here. <br/>
TRAVIS: The helm's not responding. <br/>
T'POL: We've been completely enveloped. <br/>
REED: Main power's going down. <br/>
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm picking up something out there. I think it's a ship. <br/>
ARCHER: Can you identify it? <br/>
TRAVIS: There's too much distortion. <br/>
T'POL: A tractor beam's locked on to us. We've been pulled out. <br/>
HOSHI: They're hailing us. <br/>
ARCHER: I guess we owe someone a thank-you. <br/>
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Captain Archer. Look at the trouble you've
gotten your pink skin into this time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ready room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SHRAN: You're braver than I imagined. I wouldn't
try to traverse an anomaly field in a ship this fragile. <br/>
ARCHER: You don't seem to be having any trouble. <br/>
SHRAN: We've discovered a few tricks to deal with them. <br/>
T'POL: How did you locate us? <br/>
SHRAN: We have a record of your warp signature from our last encounter.
Our ships are considerably faster than Enterprise. It wasn't difficult
to catch up with you. <br/>
ARCHER: That explains how you got here. It doesn't explain why. <br/>
SHRAN: Your world was brutally attacked. The Imperial Guard thought
you'd be grateful to have an ally, considering no one else came rushing
to your aid. <br/>
T'POL: And how did the Imperial Guard know Earth had been attacked? <br/>
SHRAN: Seven million killed? Not exactly a state secret. <br/>
T'POL: Especially if you're monitoring communications between Starfleet
and the Vulcan High Command. <br/>
SHRAN: What happened to your uniform, Sub-Commander? Not that I don't
find your new look becoming, but it's not exactly regulation, is it? <br/>
T'POL: I resigned my commission. <br/>
SHRAN: Yes, I believe I heard something about that. <br/>
ARCHER: Why are you here? <br/>
SHRAN: Your world is in jeopardy, and where are your friends, the
Vulcans? Where is their mighty fleet? They couldn't even spare one
officer. She was forced to abandon her career to remain on your ship. A
remarkably selfless act, for a Vulcan. But we've come to your aid.
We've come into the Expanse when they refused. We're here to help you.
If you don't want our assistance, we'll leave you to deal with the
Xindi on your own. Just like the Vulcans have done. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Armoury]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> REED: Targeting sensors are down, hull plating.
We're damn lucky the torpedoes were all in safe mode. If one of them
had detonated. <br/>
ARCHER: Phase cannons? <br/>
REED: They haven't even got enough power to light a camp fire. <br/>
ARCHER: How long to fix them? <br/>
REED: I couldn't even guess without a chance to sort this out. <br/>
ARCHER: Commander Shran offered to send his Tactical Officer over to
help. <br/>
REED: We'd be giving them access to critical systems, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: The kemocite signal Hoshi picked up could lead us to the Xindi
weapon. We're going to need our defences. I don't like the idea of
having the Andorians down here any more than you do, but we could use
their help. <br/>
REED: Aye, sir. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: The Andorian shuttle has docked. <br/>
ARCHER: Good. Let's put them to work. <br/>
T'POL: I recommend we assign a security detail to each repair crew. <br/>
ARCHER: You been talking to Lieutenant Reed? They're here to help,
T'Pol. <br/>
T'POL: That doesn't mean we shouldn't exercise caution. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm not going to ask them to work with guns at their heads just
because you don't like them. <br/>
T'POL: I neither like nor dislike Andorians. I've simply had a great
deal of experience with them. <br/>
ARCHER: I appreciate that, but whatever problems exist between Vulcan
and Andoria don't involve us. <br/>
T'POL: Not at the moment. We weren't always so antagonistic, Captain.
In fact, despite their heightened emotions, our first contact with
Andorians seemed promising. <br/>
ARCHER: What happened? <br/>
T'POL: They were duplicitous. They only honoured agreements that didn't
conflict with their interests. <br/>
ARCHER: Is that your assessment or the High Commands? <br/>
T'POL: Considering the importance of this mission, I feel compelled to
point out that they've proven untrustworthy in the past. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't trust them either, T'Pol, but based on my experience I
think I can trust Commander Shran. </font></p>

REED: Worse. <br/>
TALAS: Which one of you is Reed? <br/>
REED: I'm Lieutenant Reed. <br/>
TALAS: I assumed I'd find you in the Armoury, not relaxing here. What
is that? <br/>
REED: It's coffee, and just for the record, I haven't left the Armoury
for so much as a bathroom break in nearly twelve hours. And you are? <br/>
TALAS: Lieutenant Talas of the Imperial Warship Kumari. <br/>
REED: This is Commander Tucker, our Chief Engineer. <br/>
TUCKER: Pleasure. <br/>
TALAS: I've been ordered to assist you. <br/>
REED: Indeed. Well, I'll see if I can find something for you to do. <br/>
TALAS: I have duties of my own. The sooner your ship is repaired, the
sooner I can get back to them. <br/>

two glasses and a tall curvy bottle of something blue.)<br/>
ARCHER: I appreciate the gesture, but we have a lot of repairs to make.
<br/>
SHRAN: And your crew's doing a fine job of making them. Have a drink
with me. You've earned a brief respite. Andorian ale. You seemed to
enjoy it the last time we met. I took the liberty of bringing a few
extra bottles. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Archer takes the small, half-filled glass.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

SHRAN: To a swift victory. <br/>(Shran knocks his back in one.) <br/>
ARCHER: So, how did you get picked for this assignment? <br/>
SHRAN: I volunteered. It made sense. I've had the greatest amount of
contact with pink, with humans, and the last time we met you helped my
people avert a war. I don't like unpaid debts. <br/>
ARCHER: We keep doing each other favours. <br/>
SHRAN: Isn't that how alliances are born? <br/>(They make another silent toast.) </font></p>

you're here, maybe you can give me a hand. Touch this onto the phase
regulator, there, while I check the polarity. I thought you might be
avoiding me. <br/>
T'POL: Three neuro-pressure sessions a week is hardly avoiding you. The
Captain asked for an update on your repairs. <br/>
TUCKER: Three of the injectors are burnt out, the restrictor coils are
completely fried. <br/>
T'POL: How long until we have warp? <br/>
TUCKER: I would say at least two days, but the blue guys really know
their stuff. Should be up and running in about twelve hours? Is there a

more precisely. <br/>

TALAS: Is there anything else I can get you? Some coffee, perhaps? <br/>
REED: That'd be lovely. <br/>
TALAS: Since you clearly don't need my help, I'll return to my ship.
Thank you for the hospitality. <br/>
REED: Give my regards to Commander Shran. <br/>
TALAS: For what it's worth, Lieutenant, I'm not here to steal your
secrets. It would hardly be worth the effort. <br/>
REED: I beg your pardon? <br/>
TALAS: Last time I saw weapons like these was during my early tactical
training. <br/>
REED: I'm sorry I wasted your time on our primitive systems. <br/>
TALAS: Not at all. I found it nostalgic. Just be careful when you
reconnect that to your power grid. You didn't reset the EPS
synchroniser. You may singe your eyebrows when you bring it back
online. <br/>
REED: Lieutenant Talas. I apologise if I've been rude. Why don't I get
us both a cup of coffee and we can align these relays together. </font></p>

SHRAN: Why attack an uninhabited system? <br/>
ARCHER: I don't think they attacked anyone. It's Bikini Atoll. <br/>
SHRAN: What? <br/>
ARCHER: When my species was developing primitive nuclear weapons they
needed places to test them. One was a remote island called Bikini
Atoll. <br/>
T'POL: So you believe this is some kind of proving ground. <br/>
ARCHER: It's possible. If they are getting ready to test their weapon,
we're running out of time. <br/>
SHRAN: I wouldn't recommend a frontal assault. Your weapons are
damaged, critical systems are down all over your ship, and your
out-numbered four to one. <br/>
T'POL: I thought it was four to two. <br/>
SHRAN: Even our combined forces don't stand a chance against that kind
of firepower. I'm not ready to risk my ship when we don't even know if
the Xindi weapon is here. <br/>

SHRAN: Mister Tucker. How are your repairs coming along? <br/>
TUCKER: Pretty well, thanks to your people, but I was wondering if I
could ask a favour. I'm told your anti-matter injectors use variable
compression nozzles. <br/>
SHRAN: Told by whom? That's rather sensitive information. <br/>
TUCKER: I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but one of those
injectors would work wonders for our engines. <br/>
SHRAN: I imagine it would. I don't know, Commander, that's a
sophisticated piece of technology. <br/>
TUCKER: I thought we were allies here. <br/>
SHRAN: That remains to be seen. You have my condolences over the attack
on your world. <br/>
TUCKER: Thanks. <br/>
SHRAN: I understand your sister was killed. Captain Archer told me. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, lots of people lost family. <br/>
SHRAN: No great victory comes without sacrifice. The dispute between my
people and the Vulcans hasn't been bloodless. Border skirmishes were
common a few decades ago. They'd violate our territory, we'd retaliate.
I was still in school when my older brother joined the Imperial Guard.
He was assigned to a forward surveillance unit. I can understand why
you seek vengeance against these Xindi. <br/>
TUCKER: I'd love to get my hands on whoever ordered that attack, but
that's not why we're here. <br/>
SHRAN: You have no desire to make these people pay for the death of
your sister? <br/>
TUCKER: I just want to make sure they don't get the chance to finish
what they started. <br/>(Tucker opens the airlock.) <br/>TUCKER: So, any help you can give us. <br/>

T'POL: It's emitting high levels of radiation. <br/>
SHRAN: It could be anything. Power generator of some kind, fusion
reactor. <br/>
T'POL: It has the same quantum signature as the weapon that attacked
Earth. <br/>
ARCHER: What's the status of our repairs? <br/>
T'POL: Impulse and warp engines are nominal, hull plating's at eighty
two percent. <br/>

T'POL: Mister Reed reports the anomaly caused more damage that he
originally estimated. <br/>
ARCHER: How long? <br/>
T'POL: He isn't certain. Perhaps two days. <br/>
ARCHER: If they are here to test that thing, we may not have two days. <br/>
SHRAN: Why the urgency? This can't be the final version of the weapon.
T'Pol's analysis shows it isn't powerful enough to destroy an entire
planet. Let them run their tests. Why destroy this prototype when we
can see it in use and gauge it's destructive power? <br/>
ARCHER: I don't intend to destroy it. If we could get our hands on this
weapon, Starfleet might be able to figure out a defence. We're going to
take it. </font></p>

detected power fluctuations. It appears it was building toward an

ARCHER: Gralik. An arboreal Xindi that we met at a facility that
manufactured one of the components for the weapon. He promised to help
us. Looks like he kept his word. <br/>

ARCHER: We've got to get to it before they do. What if we shield the
launch bay, evacuate all the adjacent compartments. Could we bring it
aboard any sooner? <br/>

secure the device in our cargo bay until it's safe to transfer to
