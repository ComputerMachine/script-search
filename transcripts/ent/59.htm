      GRALIK: The kemocite is extremely refined. <br/>
      ARCHER: Did it come from this facility? <br/>
      GRALIK: It did. We supply many species with kemocite, not just Xindi. 
      It has countless applications. When Degra requested shipments so 
      highly refined, we celebrated, realising the wealth it would bring 
      to our colony. We never considered why he wanted such pure kemocite. 
      Perhaps our greed blinded us from the possibility that it would be used in constructing a weapon. <br/>
      ARCHER: Is Degra a reptilian? <br/>
      GRALIK: No, he's a Xindi Primate. <br/>
      ARCHER: I met one at a mining complex. <br/>
      GRALIK: They're similar to you. Ape-like. Degra and his people have 
      always been fair, truthful. That may have been why I believed him when 
      he said the shipment was for research. Perhaps he's become as untrustworthy 
      as the reptilians. <br/>
      ARCHER: We've run into a few of them, too. It's hard to imagine five sentient 
      species evolving on the same planet. <br/>

      GRALIK: Extinct. As far as I'm told, none of them fled before our homeworld was destroyed. <br/>
      ARCHER: We found some debris. How did it happen? <br/>
      GRALIK: The war went on for nearly a hundred years. The sides changed, alliances were 
      forged and then broken. By the time it ended I doubt any of the six species remembered 
      what started it, but everyone remembered what ended it. As well as being unstable politically, 
      our planet was even more unstable geologically. In a final desperate act, the insectoids and 
      reptilians detonated massive explosions beneath the eight largest seismic fissures. I'd like 
      to think they didn't realise how devastating the result would be. My grandfather lived there. 
      He told me of places where the sky was sometimes filled with avians. Now they're gone. <br/>
      ARCHER: The other five species did survive. From what I can tell, they don't all live on 
      remote colonies like this one. <br/>
