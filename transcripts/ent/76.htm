HUMANOID: I can't tell. <br/>

from the inside. Any luck? <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: Report. <br/>
TUCKER: We've realigned the main power grid. It should increase the
deflector pulse threefold, maybe four, but it's going to fry just about
every system on board. <br/>
T'POL: Be prepared to initiate the pulse within two hours. <br/>
TUCKER: I don't think you heard what I just said. We try this and the
ship's going to come apart at the seams. <br/>
T'POL: Two hours, Mister Tucker. <br/>
TUCKER: The Captain told the Xindi we'd try to knock these things out.
He didn't say anything about demolishing Enterprise in the process. <br/>
T'POL: Has it occurred to you what's going to happen if Captain Archer
fails? If Earth is destroyed? <br/>
TUCKER: Every day. <br/>
T'POL: Good. Then you've already come to the conclusion that without
humanity there's no one to combat these Sphere Builders. Their Expanse
will continue to grow, encompassing one system after another, including
Vulcan. Your world is no longer the only one in jeopardy. Two hours. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TRAVIS: I think we've got a problem. <br/>
T'POL: What is it? <br/>
TRAVIS: Sphere Forty One. <br/>
T'POL: Are you certain these are the coordinates? <br/>
TRAVIS: Yep. There shouldn't be anything on sensors, not with the
cloaking barrier, but there it is and it's getting bigger. <br/>
T'POL: Have you analysed it? <br/>
TRAVIS: Could be spatial anomalies, but they're clustered much tighter
than we've ever seen them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: They're transforming the space around that
Sphere. Not unlike the disturbance where we found that
trans-dimensional being. They obviously expected us. <br/>
T'POL: If we're going to disable the network we'll need to get within a
kilometre of the surface. <br/>
PHLOX: If the ship were to enter that disturbance, the entire crew
would be dead within minutes. I could synthesise a neuraleptic compound
that would keep us conscious for approximately twelve minutes. I'm
afraid there's nothing I can do to prevent epidermal decay. <br/>
T'POL: Twelve minutes won't be enough. <br/>
PHLOX: Perhaps I can extend it, but not by much. I encourage you and
Mister Tucker to encourage alternatives. There must be something you
can do to abbreviate your plan. </font></p>

HOSHI: I'm not feeling very well. Do you think you can get Phlox to
come down here? <br/>
ARCHER: We're on Degra's ship, Hoshi. Phlox isn't here. <br/>
HOSHI: I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing. <br/>
ARCHER: The schematics for the weapon. Degra encrypted them before he
was killed. You've been trying to decipher them. <br/>
HOSHI: I gave them the third code. They wouldn't have been able to arm
the weapon if I hadn't given them the third code. <br/>
ARCHER: You were drugged, Hoshi. You had no choice. <br/>
HOSHI: I did. I should have fought harder. <br/>
ARCHER: You need to finish what you're doing. You're almost there.
We're going to board the weapon, try to overload the power systems, but
we can't do that until we can read these schematics. <br/>
HOSHI: I tried to jump but I wasn't fast enough. <br/>
ARCHER: You need to finish this. <br/>
HOSHI: You've got the three codes so why don't you just kill me? Didn't
you say you're going to kill me? <br/>
ARCHER: You've got to pull yourself together just for a little while
longer. You need to complete the decryption. Everything hinges on it.
Do you understand? <br/>
HOSHI: I understand. </font></p>

be? <br/>
LIEUTENANT: Approximately two million kilometres from Earth. <br/>
DOLIM: Two million! <br/>
LIEUTENANT: If we had all five codes we could begin the firing sequence
immediately, but with three we'll need additional time. We'd be
vulnerable if we dropped into normal space any closer to the target. <br/>

TUCKER: I think I've found a way to boost the deflector pulse without
tearing the ship apart, but it's going to mean transferring all impulse
power to the array. <br/>
TRAVIS: When? <br/>
TUCKER: As soon as we reach the Sphere. <br/>
TRAVIS: Sir. <br/>
TUCKER: Sorry, Travis. You're going to have to get us to the manifold
on thrusters only. <br/>
TRAVIS: That's tying my hands, Commander, especially with the ticking
clock. <br/>
TUCKER: You can do it. Look over these schematics, familiarise yourself
with the features of the Sphere. </font></p>

the control platform, it's too heavily shielded. We'll have to beam in
and out no deeper than this peripheral framework. <br/>
HUMANOID: What if you need to board the weapon before your crewman
completes her decryptions? <br/>
ARCHER: I'm taking her with me. <br/>
REED: Sir, she's hardly in any shape <br/>
ARCHER: She's been there, Malcolm. That's where she deciphered that
third launch code. <br/>
REED: She was drugged. There's no reason to believe that she'll
remember anything. <br/>
ARCHER: She's coming with me. I want you and your team to beam in right
before we do. Secure the closest route to the platform. <br/>
JANNAR If you succeed in creating the overload, what makes you think
you'll be able to get out in time? <br/>
ARCHER: I'll give everyone a chance to get to the outer framework.
You'll be in charge of helping Hoshi. <br/>
REED: And you, sir? <br/>

DANIELS: This is a very important day, Jonathan. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't have time for this. <br/>
DANIELS: It'll only take a minute. You see the fellow in the blue
jacket, near the left hand of the dais? That's you, a little more than
seven years from now. You and the others are about to make history. Do
you remember I told you about a Federation? <br/>
ARCHER: What about it? <br/>
DANIELS: I work with some people who are going to be pretty angry with
me for telling you this, but you're going to be an integral part of
forming that Federation. You're down there, right now, with Vulcans,
Andorians and Tellarites, getting ready to sign the Charter. The
membership is going to grow. Dozen, eventually hundreds of species. A
United Federation of Planets. <br/>
ARCHER: I have a team preparing to board the weapon. I've got other
things to think about right now. <br/>
DANIELS: Let Reed or one of the others go to the control platform. <br/>
ARCHER: What are you talking about? <br/>
DANIELS: It's too great a risk. If you're killed, none of this will
happen. At least, not the way it's supposed to happen. <br/>
ARCHER: Then it'll happen some other way. Who's to say whether it'll be
better or worse? <br/>
DANIELS: It's essential you be a part of this. <br/>
ARCHER: Where are we? What planet? <br/>
DANIELS: Earth. <br/>
ARCHER: Seems to me it's just as essential that Earth be around for
this too. <br/>
DANIELS: Lieutenant Reed can work with Sato. (applause in background)
They are not crucial to the future of mankind. You are. <br/>
ARCHER: My mission is to save Earth, not your Federation. <br/>

sweet little girl, she must be eight or nine by now. Well, I would like
to leave her my botanical library. She always had a flair for plants.

colleague, Doctor Lucas. He offered to make sure my affairs were in

when entering a dangerous situation. <br/>

the right order, internal safeguards will kick in and it'll be
impossible to create an overload. <br/>
HOSHI: I've found the sequence, but decrypting it's another story. Your

MACO sniper takes them out with one falling into the centre of the
weapon, then gets caught by a Reptilian. There's a brief hand to hand
struggle before he is stabbed and falls into the middle of the weapon
himself. The Reptilian shoots at Hoshi and she drops her PADD into the
void.)<br/>

destroying it as well and causing it to send out another beam. The
aliens jerk upright in pain and vanish. Ships systems are restored.) <br/>
T'POL: The network is being destroyed. <br/>
MAYWEATHER: Looks like we're getting out of this soup faster than we

reactor. <br/>

REED: But if we knock the reactor out, won't that be enough? <br/>
ARCHER: We didn't come here to disable this weapon, we're here to
destroy it. Give me the charges. <br/>

charges and detonator, and leaves with Hoshi and the MACO. As Hoshi
turns to look at him, he says) <br/>
ARCHER: Don't worry, I'll be right behind you. <br/>
(He sticks the charges on the twirly gizmo and detonates them. It stops
twirling and goes dark. He turns the final rod upside down and a klaxon
sounds. Then he gets grabbed.) <br/>
DOLIM: What have you done! <br/>
(They fight. The Reptilian is much stronger, and almost throws him to
his death, but he grabs a rail in time. Explosions shake the weapon and
Dolim looses his footing as Archer clambers back up and starts kicking
him in the face. Dolim soon fights back, throwing Archer against a
stanchion.) </font></p>

it. Archer manages to put a spare explosive charge on the Reptilian's
back and get away from him. Then he smugly detonates it. Splat.
Silhouetted by fire he runs along a gantry to the outer framework. The
weapon explodes above Earth's atmosphere.) </font></p>

TUCKER: What about the thermobaric cloud barrier? <br/>
T'POL: I can only detect a small section from our location, but it
appears to be dissipating. <br/>

birthday. <br/>
TUCKER: I can't believe you told me that. <br/>

TUCKER: That's not what I mean. I've been trying to get you to tell me
