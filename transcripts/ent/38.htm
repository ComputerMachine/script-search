Captain's Starlog, September 18th, 2152. We've entered orbit of an
uninhabited planet. Our scans show it's teeming with all sorts of plant
and animal life. I'll be leading a survey team to the surface. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Launch bay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TUCKER: There's a gorge on the southern continent
five times deeper than the Grand Canyon. <br/>
ARCHER: What have you got in mind? <br/>
TUCKER: How about a little river rafting? T'Pol says it only gets dark
four days a month because of the binary suns. We'll have plenty of
daylight left after we're done working every night. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Shuttlepod]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Archer settles into the shuttlepod.) <br/></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: It's going
to take at least a week to complete the survey. Should be enough time
to sneak in some R and R. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer. <br/>
ARCHER: Go ahead. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: We've got an alien vessel approaching. They're hailing us. <br/>
ARCHER: Put them through to Shuttlepod One. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: Yes, sir. <br/>
TUCKER: New planet, new aliens. Banner day. <br/>
(An image of three bald males comes up on the monitor.) <br/>
TAGRIM [on monitor]: We're very relieved to see you. I'm Rellus Tagrim.
This is my crew. <br/>
ARCHER: Captain Archer of the Starship Enterprise. Something we can do
for you? <br/>
TAGRIM [on monitor]: Considering the circumstances, we would like
permission to come aboard as soon as possible. <br/>
ARCHER: What circumstances? <br/>
TAGRIM [on monitor]: The neutronic wavefront. It's almost here. <br/>
TUCKER: Nothing on sensors. <br/>
TAGRIM [on monitor]: You should detect the storm in a few minutes. It's
travelling at high warp. Once we're aboard, I suggest you go to warp
seven immediately. <br/>
ARCHER: Our top speed is warp five. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Situation room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: The wavefront spans more than half a dozen
light years. A Vulcan starship encountered a class five over a century
ago. The vessel was nearly destroyed. <br/>
ARCHER: How long until it hits? <br/>
T'POL: Approximately four hours. <br/>
REED: If we reinforce structural integrity we should be able to weather
it without too much trouble. <br/>
PHLOX: Enterprise may survive. The crew is another matter. The storm is
saturated with radiolytic isotopes. If the crew is exposed, they'll be
dead within three minutes. Sickbay is the most heavily shielded
section. It's possible that some of the crew could survive there. <br/>
ARCHER: We can't fit eighty three people into Sickbay, and I'm not
about to draw lots. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Tucker studies a schematic on another monitor.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
TUCKER: What about the
Catwalk? You know, the maintenance shaft running the length of each
nacelle. <br/>
ARCHER: They are heavily shielded. Some kind of osmium alloy, if I
remember. <br/>
T'POL: You're proposing we take refuge in a crawlspace? <br/>
TUCKER: It'll be a tight squeeze, but there's no reason we can't fit
eighty three people in there, and whatever supplies we need. <br/>
ARCHER: Doctor? <br/>
PHLOX: Do you know the absorption depth of this alloy? <br/>
TUCKER: At least twenty thousand particles per micron. <br/>
PHLOX: It should be adequate. <br/>
TUCKER: There's just one other problem. It gets kind of toasty in there
when the warp coils are online. About three hundred degrees. We'd have
to shut down the main reactor. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't see that we have any choice. We'll use the Catwalk, and
set up a command station in one of the compartments. <br/>
TUCKER: Aye, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER (to T'Pol) You'll be in charge of the evacuation. Take us out of
orbit, Travis. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Catwalk]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Long and narrow with rails either side of a
walkway just wide enough for two people to squeeze past each other.) <br/>
TRAVIS: Maybe we should open a window. <br/>
TUCKER: You think it's stuffy now, wait till we get eighty three people
in here. <br/>
TRAVIS: And don't forget Porthos, and all the Doctor's animals. <br/>
TUCKER: You ever been through a storm as bad as this? <br/>
TRAVIS: Ran into a Class three once. Had to take shelter in the ship's
core. We were down there for six weeks. <br/>
TUCKER: Six weeks? <br/>
TRAVIS: Any idea about a latrine? <br/>
TUCKER: Oh, I never thought about that. There are some storage lockers
in the aft compartment. We ought to be able to convert a couple of
them. <br/>
(They go through a hatchway into another section with control panels on
the wall.) <br/>
TUCKER: This'll be our Bridge. We're going to have to jury-rig these
panels, tap them into command functions. <br/>
TRAVIS: Not much room for a Captain's chair. <br/>
TUCKER: That storm must've been pretty scary. <br/>
TRAVIS: We only got worried when the generators went down. We lost the
grav-plating, life support. I'll never forget that look in my father's
eyes. He knew we were in trouble. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Phlox and Archer escort the three aliens out of
the Decon chamber.) <br/>
ARCHER: Sorry to keep you in there so long. Please. <br/>
TAGRIM: We understand. <br/>
ARCHER: My Science Officer tells me you're from the Takret system.
That's a long way from here. <br/>
TAGRIM: Our work often takes us far from home. <br/>
RENTH: We're stellar cartographers. <br/>
ARCHER: Really? Once we get out of the storm maybe you can help us
update our star charts. <br/>
TAGRIM: We'd be pleased. <br/>
PHLOX: This way.<br/>(The ship is a frenzy of activity. The warp
injectors are being locked down. Duffle bags are being passed up the
ladders to the catwalk, spacesuits are being packed and moved.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: You're behind schedule. Do you need help? <br/>
PHLOX: I understand you've allotted fifteen cubic metres for medical
supplies? <br/>
T'POL: That's correct. <br/>
PHLOX: That means there's only enough room for two-thirds of these
cages. <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps some of your creatures could share. <br/>
PHLOX: They'll eat each other. They're vital to my work and the health
of this crew. I'm not accustomed to making emotional appeals. Please,
don't ask me to choose between them. <br/>
T'POL: All right. Twenty cubic metres. <br/>
PHLOX: My Edosian slugs thank you. </font></p>

TUCKER: I'm afraid these aren't first class accommodations. <br/>
TAGRIM: They'll be fine, Commander. We're grateful for your
hospitality. <br/>
TUCKER: We're going to have a lot of time to get to know each other. If
you need anything, I'll be right over here. <br/>
(He leaves them.) <br/>
GURI: I don't know the first thing about stellar cartography. <br/>
TAGRIM: Guri. <br/>
GURI: What if they begin to ask questions? </font></p>

to watch the purple ribbon-like phenomenon approaching. Hmm, familiar.)
<br/>
ARCHER: Come in. (T'Pol enters) I didn't expect it to be beautiful. Too
bad we don't have time to run some scans. <br/>
T'POL: We'll be inside the phenomenon for nearly eight days. We can run
all the scans we want. Lieutenant Reed has completed his modifications.
<br/>
ARCHER: I'm a little nervous about shutting down the power grid. <br/>
T'POL: A single neutronic surge could overload the grid and damage
critical systems. <br/>
ARCHER: I did a little research in the Vulcan database. That Class five
storm a century ago involved the Starship T'Plana. Apparently, they
couldn't outrun the wavefront. It was lost with all hands. I thought
you said it was nearly destroyed. <br/>
T'POL: I must have remembered incorrectly. </font></p>

TUCKER: Entire crew's accounted for, including one quadruped. Would you
like to try out the Captain's chair? <br/>
(He pets Porthos then looks at a few barrels with netting on top.) <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe later. Where's the comm.? <br/>(Tucker gestures to a column.) <br/>ARCHER: All
hands, this is the Captain. This catwalk is going to be our home for a
while. A week, maybe more. You may not be comfortable, but you'll be
alive. We have the best crew in the fleet and the sturdiest ship. I
promise you, we'll get through this. <br/>(He closes the comm.) <br/>ARCHER: Time? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(T'Pol's station is the other side of the column.)</font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

TRAVIS: Spatial turbulence. <br/>
T'POL: Twenty seconds. Fifteen. Ten. <br/>

Earth. Six letters, ends with an R? <br/>
ARCHER: Solkar, I think. <br/>
CREWWOMAN: Thanks, Captain. <br/>

HOSHI: Pretty well, sir. A few
days in this place should cure anyone of claustrophobia. <br/>
ARCHER: Your quarters will probably feel like a ballroom after this. <br/>
(There's another shake) <br/>
HOSHI: You're the Captain. Can't you order the storm to calm down a
little? <br/>
ARCHER: I'll see what I can do. <br/>
(He walks under the privacy curtain that will divide the women from the
men - a blanket actually. The alien guests have also put blankets up
around their area to screen it off. Subtitles give some of the
incidental conversations.) <br/>

about it? <br/>
CREWMAN: How should I know? <br/>
VOICE: Another day in this place. <br/>
VOICE: We're running out of food. <br/>
(There are at least two card games on the go.) <br/>
ARCHER: (referring to aliens) How're they doing? <br/>
TUCKER: Your guess is as good as mine. One of them came out a few hours
ago. Told us we were making too much noise. Now, I've been real
friendly. Even asked them to join the game. Doesn't seem like they want
anything to do with us. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's give them a little time to adjust. <br/>
TUCKER: You know, I bet by now we'd have set up camp on the rim of that
canyon, had a fire going. <br/>

PHLOX: PalantiI, are you passing through or is there something I can
help you with? <br/>
REED: Actually, there is something. <br/>(Reed climbs down into Phlox's area.) <br/>
PHLOX: Yes? <br/>
REED: I assume I can depend on doctor-patient confidentiality. <br/>
PHLOX: This wouldn't have anything to do with gastrointestinal
distress? <br/>
REED: Is it that obvious? <br/>
PHLOX: Not at all. There's a notation in your medical file. Something
about an unfortunate incident during zero g training. <br/>
REED: The EV simulator at Lunaport, or as Starfleet trainees call it,
The Vomitorium. <br/>
PHLOX: Nothing to be embarrassed about. I've treated a number of
crewmen this afternoon for motion sickness. <br/>(Phlox gives him a hypospray.)
<br/>PHLOX: That should last for about twelve hours. <br/>
REED: Thank you, Doctor. <br/>
ARCHER: Feeling all right, Malcolm? <br/>
REED: Never better. <br/>(Reed leaves.) <br/>

serious. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Archer surveys the array of cages.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
ARCHER: I could see about moving some of
this to the aft section. <br/>
PHLOX: Nonsense. I have plenty of room. I find the close quarters
rather comforting. Reminds me of home. <br/>

TRAVIS: Aye, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: When we're past those eddies, try and get some rest yourself.
Ensign Tanner can relieve you. <br/>

working on the other side of the room. Porthos joins his master for a
good petting session then trots back to his basket) <br/>

match, complete with sound and his own reactions. He feels T'Pol's
glare hitting him and looks up.) <br/>
ARCHER: Does this bother you? <br/>
T'POL: Only slightly. <br/>
(Archer turns off the PADD and settles down to sleep, but with the
light on and T'Pol tapping at her PADD, it's not easy.) <br/>
T'POL: Am I disturbing you? <br/>

(She turns off her PADD and lies down.) <br/>
ARCHER: You know, there's a bright side to all of this. <br/>
T'POL: Really. <br/>
ARCHER: It's bringing the crew closer together. If you forget about the
storm outside, this is almost like going on a camping trip. <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps we can sing a few songs later. <br/>
ARCHER: Haven't you ever gone camping? <br/>
T'POL: In a manner of speaking. I once participated in the kahswan
ritual. I was taken to the desert and left to survive for ten days. <br/>
ARCHER: Sounds fun. You haven't left the command area much today. You
might want to wander around, get to know the crew. <br/>
T'POL: I'm familiar with every one of them. <br/>
ARCHER: There's a lot more to these people than just their names. It'd
be good for you to fraternise a little. <br/>
T'POL: Is that an order? <br/>
ARCHER: Does it have to be? <br/>
T'POL: I'm not skilled at fraternising. <br/>
ARCHER: Here's a chance to learn.<br/>(Tucker, Malcolm, Hoshi and Travis are playing
poker.) <br/>
REED: I'll see your strawberry shortcake, and I'll raise you one
pineapple cobbler. <br/>

TRAVIS: Broccoli? <br/>
HOSHI: I'm out of desserts. <br/>
TRAVIS: Call. <br/>
REED: Oh, what I wouldn't give for a shower right about now. When this
hand's over maybe you could look into building one. <br/>
TUCKER: Would you like a sauna while I'm at it? <br/>
REED: You knew we'd be stuck in here for over a week. You might've
given it a little thought to making it tolerable. <br/>
TUCKER: I only had four hours, Malcolm. You're lucky we've got a
toilet. <br/>
REED: Well, I obviously overestimated your people's abilities when it
comes to indoor plumbing. <br/>
TUCKER: You want to take a shower? Build one yourself. <br/>

we don't get to see his face.) <br/>

TRAVIS: Anyone know what they're showing tonight? <br/>
TUCKER: The Day the Earth Stood Still. <br/>
REED: We're having movie night in here? <br/>
TUCKER: Captain's orders. I set up a monitor in Compartment Five. The
screen's a little small, but <br/>
HOSHI: Who's picking these movies? Shouldn't we all get a vote? <br/>
TRAVIS: I think something's burning. <br/>
(Smoke is coming from the alien's area. Trip dashes over and pulls open
the blanket curtain to discover them cooking over a stove.) <br/>
TUCKER: Are you aware you're sitting on top of a plasma manifold? You
got to turn that thing off! <br/>
TAGRIM: I apologise, Commander. We should've spoken with you first. <br/>
TUCKER: That might've been a good idea. <br/>

ARCHER: Not happy with your bunk mates? <br/>
TUCKER: I caught them throwing a barbecue next to a plasma manifold.
Now, I understand we're explorers. We're supposed to keep an open mind
about different cultures, but these guys are driving me crazy. They
only need to sleep once a week, so they've kept us up the last two
nights with their strange rituals. Chanting, walking in circles.
They've practically taken over the compartment. <br/>

notices a piece of equipment on the floor. He checks the injectors and
sees they have been tampered with. Then he hears someone else moving
around and turns off his lights, along with the monitor screen he had
activated. He hides and watches two figures moving around. The
intruders go to the injectors and do something, so Trip sets off an
alarm to distract them while he makes his escape. The aliens are not
wearing space suits, by the way. Out in a corridor, three more aliens
march past. They look as if they are in uniforms. Trip avoids them,
then goes to a porthole and looks out. There is a ship docked
alongside. He activates a monitor and calls up the Bridge security

ARCHER: Who are they? What are they doing here? <br/>
TAGRIM: Captain, I assure you. We don't know these men. <br/>
ARCHER: They just happened to find Enterprise in the middle of a class
five neutronic storm? Where three members of their own species just
happened to be taking refuge? <br/>
T'POL: We're more than twenty light years from your homeworld. It's an
unlikely coincidence. <br/>
ARCHER: I get the feeling they must be looking for you. Answer me! <br/>
GURI: I told you we shouldn't have come here. <br/>
TAGRIM: Guri. <br/>
RENTH: They're officers of the Takret Militia. They've been pursuing us
for weeks. We thought we could evade them by hiding aboard your ship. <br/>
GURI: They must've detected our vessel in your launch bay. <br/>
ARCHER: What do they want with you? <br/>
RENTH: We used to be members of the militia, in the lower ranks, but
after a year we realised that the commanding officers were corrupt.
They seize alien vessels without provocation. They murder the crews,
take anything of value. <br/>
GURI: They're little more than criminals. <br/>
TAGRIM: We tried to resign our commissions but they wouldn't allow it. <br/>
ARCHER: You're deserters. <br/>
TAGRIM: We had no choice. We would've told you the truth, but we
weren't sure that you would help us. <br/>
RENTH: If they find us, we'll be executed. <br/>
TAGRIM: Captain, I apologise for the difficult position that we've put
you in, but I know these men. Even if they found us, I doubt they'd
simply leave. They've captured vessels far less impressive than yours. <br/>
REED: They're trying to re-initialise the warp reactor, sir. It seems
to me they've already decided to help themselves to Enterprise. <br/>
T'POL: They obviously don't realise we're in the catwalk. If they learn
we're here, it would undoubtedly endanger the crew. <br/>
TUCKER: What're you suggesting? We just sit on our hands until they
fire up the engines? <br/>
ARCHER: You're assuming these three are telling the truth. They've
already lied to us. <br/>
TAGRIM: We're not lying. These men are dangerous. </font></p>

CAPTAIN: Answer it. <br/>
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: (sounding as if he's dying) You're in my chair.
<br/>
CAPTAIN: Captain Archer. I didn't realise you were still aboard.
Where's the rest of your crew? <br/>
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: They're dead, killed by the storm. <br/>
CAPTAIN: I'm sorry. <br/>
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: Thanks for your condolences. Now, why don't you
get the hell off my ship. <br/>
CAPTAIN: I'm afraid I can't do that. We detected a vessel in your
launch bay that belongs to three fugitives. <br/>
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: I've been watching you, I know you're trying to
take Enterprise. I'm not going to let you. <br/>
CAPTAIN: You're in no position to do anything about it. I'm in command
of this Bridge. Your vessel has been impounded under the authority of
the Takret Militia. When we return, you'll be charged with criminal
conspiracy. <br/>
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: I don't recognise your authority. I answer to
Starfleet Command, and I'm under orders to use any means necessary to
keep my ship from falling into enemy hands. <br/>
CAPTAIN: I have soldiers searching every deck. It's only a matter of
time before they find you. <br/>
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: You're leaving me no choice. I'll destroy
Enterprise. <br/>
CAPTAIN: Earth's first warp five starship? Your father's engine? I've
been reading about you, Captain, and I doubt very much if you'll do
anything to damage this vessel. <br/>
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: You would be surprised. (ends transmission) <br/>
