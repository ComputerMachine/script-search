SOONG: (with only a little silver hair) Some claim humanity rose up
against the Augments. Others say the Augments began fighting among
themselves. Whoever started it, the war devastated Earth. Millions
perished. And when it was over people like you were feared. Humans will
always fear you. They fear your power, your intellect. They fear you
because you're everything they want to be, but can't be. Which is why I
brought you here, where it's safe. I've raised you like my own. You
call me Father. But I'm only watching over you. You belong to the
future, and someday you will fulfill humanity's promise.<br/>

containment field. If you register at all on their sensors, it'll look
like a field echo.<br/>

more ships will come and they might not back down like Enterprise.<br/>
SOONG: It isn't necessary.<br/>

our lives and everything you've worked for?
