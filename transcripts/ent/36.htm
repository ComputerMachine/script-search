there's nothing to it. <br/>
HOSHI: Your molecules get pulled apart. <br/>
TUCKER: Then they get put back together again. <br/>
HOSHI: Do you know how many molecules you're made up of? <br/>
TUCKER: Lots. <br/>
HOSHI: All right, how many? <br/>
TUCKER: A few trillion. <br/>
HOSHI: That's a pretty big jigsaw puzzle. What if some other pieces get
put in the wrong place? You know, I bet a lot of them look real
similar. <br/>
TUCKER: Starfleet said it's safe. That's good enough for me. <br/>
HOSHI: Okay, okay, but you go first and if you get to Enterprise in one

go back and get it. <br/>
HOSHI: I'm sure Commander Tucker can find someone else to hold the
second flash unit. <br/>

the other pod. <br/>

TUCKER: Don't you think a Vulcan would see right through this one? <br/>

TUCKER: No, please. (she puts her tray down and sits) <br/>
TRAVIS: So, what was it like? <br/>
REED: Travis, let her eat her supper. <br/>
HOSHI: It was very unsettling. Didn't you find it unsettling? <br/>
TUCKER: For a minute or two, but once I counted my fingers and toes. <br/>
HOSHI: I don't know. I just don't feel right. <br/>
TUCKER: It was probably that storm. You don't forget things like that
too quickly. <br/>
HOSHI: Not the storms, it's the transporter. I don't feel like myself
since I went through it. I need to check the medical database and find
out what happened to people they used when they were testing that
thing. <br/>
REED: You mean other than Cyrus Ramsey? <br/>
HOSHI: Cyrus Ramsey? <br/>
TUCKER: Don't tell me you don't know about poor Cyrus. <br/>
HOSHI: Am I supposed to? <br/>
TRAVIS: You can't go on a survival overnight without hearing a story
about someone seeing Ramsey's molecules rematerialising on a foggy
night. <br/>
HOSHI: What happened to him? <br/>
TUCKER: Next thing you'll tell us you never heard of the Easter bunny. <br/>
HOSHI: What happened to him? <br/>
TUCKER: Madison, Wisconsin, May, I think, 2146. He was a test subject
for the first long-range transport. Just one hundred metres. Something
went wrong with the pattern buffer. He never rematerialised. <br/>
REED: Come on, Hoshi, everybody's heard of Cyrus Ramsey. <br/>
HOSHI: I must have fallen asleep before the ghost stories. <br/>
TUCKER: Where'd you do your survival training? <br/>
TRAVIS: Death Valley, California. Middle of July, naturally. You? <br/>
TUCKER: Captain and I were in the same group. Alice Springs, Australia.
Never saw so many flies in my life. Biting kind. (comm., chirps)
Tucker. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: The storms are breaking up. I don't think we'll have any
trouble getting you back down in the morning. <br/>
TUCKER: Travis was just telling me he'd like to see the ruins. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Well, I don't think Hoshi will be joining you. <br/>
TUCKER: I'll need a pilot to bring the other pod back. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Travis it is. I'll see you both in the morning. Archer
out. <br/>
TUCKER: Never say I don't take you anywhere. <br/>

HOSHI: You didn't hear me? <br/>
PHLOX: I'm right here, Ensign. Are you not feeling well? <br/>
HOSHI: No, I'm not feeling well. I dematerialised, and then I
rematerialised and, no, I'm not feeling well. <br/>
PHLOX: I heard about your ordeal on the surface. Those storms sounded
terrifying. <br/>
HOSHI: Doctor, I'm not talking about the storms. I'm talking about my
molecules. <br/>
PHLOX: Come sit down. Let's take a look. <br/>(He begins scanning her.) <br/>PHLOX: It'll
take me a while to account for every molecule, but you appear to be in
one piece. I don't think you're in danger of becoming the next Cyrus
Ramsey. <br/>
HOSHI: Don't tell me they talk about him on Denobula. <br/>
PHLOX: I spent nearly nine months on Earth, remember? <br/>

PHLOX: A subcutaneous pigmentation. <br/>

HOSHI: It's not a joke, Doctor. If that machine could move a birthmark,
who knows what else it could do. I'm telling you, I don't feel right. <br/>

destroy the photographs that were taken, the hostages were released. <br/>

HOSHI: Something's wrong, Doctor. Something's very wrong. Ever since I
used that transporter nothing has been the way that it's supposed to
be. I couldn't translate a simple, bi-modal syntax, but Crewman Baird
could. Crewman Baird doesn't know the first thing about our linguistic
database. And Captain Archer told me to stay in my quarters, but my
mirror doesn't want to give me a solid reflection and my shower can't
decide whether to bounce off me or go through me. Nobody wants to talk
to me. Sometimes I think they don't even see that I'm there. The
turbolift control won't even respond to me. <br/>
PHLOX: Well, I see you, Ensign, and the Sickbay doors responded when
you came in. Transporter technology is very new. (scans her) I'm sure
humans were equally frightened when the automobile was introduced, or
the airplane. New forms of transport take a while to get used to. I'm
not at all surprised at your reaction. You wouldn't catch me using that
apparatus. But I can promise you one thing. You're in perfect health.
You're neither transparent nor porous. <br/>

PHLOX: As far as I'm concerned I didn't even see you come in here. <br/>
HOSHI: Not funny, Doctor. <br/>

good night's sleep. <br/>

to be medicated. <br/>

laws of physics. <br/>

through my hand. I'm not convinced that the transporter put me back the
way it was supposed to. <br/>
TUCKER: All the king's horses and all the king's men. I can see why you
might imagine the universe unraveling. If you're afraid you haven't
been put back together right, why assume anything else makes sense? If
I were you, I'd ask the Doc for a sedative. Nothing like crawling into
bed. <br/>
HOSHI: You men are all alike. <br/>

door control is <br/>
TUCKER: She was here last night, right over there. <br/>
HOSHI: Commander. <br/>
T'POL: T'Pol to Captain Archer. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead. <br/>
T'POL: Have the security details reported back? <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: No sign of her yet. <br/>
T'POL: We've covered the forward section of C deck. She's not here. <br/>
HOSHI: Yes, she is. <br/>
TUCKER: Have you tried the biosensors again, Captain? <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Still nothing. <br/>
TUCKER: I'll go take a look at them. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: I'm going to maintain our present orbit until Hoshi turns
up. T'Pol, meet me in Sickbay right away. <br/>
T'POL: Yes, sir. <br/>
(Hoshi runs out through the open door after them.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PHLOX: She came to Sickbay after the incident with
the storm, then a second time early last night. <br/>
ARCHER: She wasn't feeling well? <br/>
PHLOX: She said she felt shaky. You're aware that was the first time
she'd ever transported? <br/>
T'POL: Quite aware. <br/>
PHLOX: I believed that was the source of her anxiety. She was convinced
her molecules hadn't been reassembled properly. I should've taken her
more seriously. These are the biomolecular scans I took during each of
her two visits. <br/>(We see Hoshi is sitting on a desk, listening.) <br/>PHLOX: They
seemed perfectly normal at the time. When I heard she was missing
something made me take a closer look. You see these protein filaments?
Now look at this. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm going to need some help here, Phlox. <br/>
PHLOX: Look how much her subcellular membranes have degraded. These
scans were taken less than twenty four hours apart. It's virtually
impossible. <br/>
ARCHER: What's impossible? <br/>
T'POL: Ensign Sato wasn't imagining it. Her molecules are coming apart.

secondary phase coils. <br/>
ARCHER: What about them? <br/>
TUCKER: They're not aligning. They're not perfectly synchronised.
Must've happened right after it came up from the surface. <br/>
PHLOX: If they're not perfectly synchronised? <br/>
T'POL: The resequencing would start to dissipate. Within hours, she'll
lose molecular cohesion. <br/>
TUCKER: She didn't want to go first. I told her I wouldn't leave her
alone with that storm coming but she insisted on going second. She
wanted to be sure it was working, that it was safe. I'm the one who
should be missing. I told her to go first. She should've listened to
me. <br/>
HOSHI: It wasn't your fault. <br/>
ARCHER: Take the transporter offline and figure out what went wrong.
Starfleet promised me this sort of thing wouldn't happen. <br/>
TUCKER: Aye, sir. <br/>
PHLOX: Captain, if there was a loss of molecular cohesion I'm afraid we
shouldn't be looking for Hoshi, per se. <br/>
ARCHER: What should we be looking for? <br/>
PHLOX: Subcellular residue. There wouldn't be anything left by now
except for subcellular residue. <br/>
HOSHI: You're wrong, Doctor. I'm still in one piece. You just can't see
me. <br/>
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) Have the Doctor help you recalibrate the sensors.
Then start scanning for this residue. Archer to Mayweather. <br/>
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: Prepare to break orbit and resume previous course. <br/>
TRAVIS: [OC]: Aye, Captain. <br/>

slowly and sadly.) </font></p>

certain this is her. <br/>
TUCKER: Is it Hoshi's DNA or isn't it? <br/>
PHLOX: It's difficult to tell. The amino acids have broken down. <br/>
HOSHI: Don't waste your time. It's not me. <br/>
TUCKER: The internal scan said access shaft B7. She's got to be here
somewhere. <br/>
HOSHI: If you spent a little more time trying to figure out what
happened to <br/>(She hears another voice and goes to investigate.) <br/>
ALIEN [OC]: (something) <br/>
TUCKER [OC]: What's the problem? <br/>
REED [OC]: The stream's too unstable. <br/>
HOSHI: Lieutenant? <br/>
REED [OC]: You can do it, Ensign. It's as easy as one, two <br/>
TUCKER: Here, Doc, over here. What do you think? <br/>
PHLOX: Try isolating the dipeptides. Now run a comparison with her
genetic profile. <br/>(The scanner shows a match.) <br/>
TUCKER: Why would she have come down here? <br/>
PHLOX: I doubt we'll ever know, Commander. Captain Archer will want
Hoshi's parents to have this. <br/>(He scrapes a bit of gloop up off the floor
into a small envelope.) <br/>PHLOX: They're both alive, aren't they? <br/>
TUCKER: Yeah, both alive. You go ahead, Doc. I'm going to stick around
for a minute. <br/>
PHLOX: I understand. <br/>(Phlox leaves.)<br/>
TUCKER: Hoshi. <br/>
HOSHI: You can see me? <br/>
TUCKER: I should've made you go first. What could I have been thinking
leaving you down there? I was the ranking officer, and I had no
business leaving a subordinate in the path of those storms. Why didn't
you listen to me? I told you we'd be safe. And now look what you've
done. <br/>(Tucker leaves.)<br/>
ALIEN [OC]: (something)<br/>

devices to the bulkheads and talking to a companion who is doing the
same.) </font></p>

closed door.) <br/>
HOSHI: Captain, I need you to listen to me. There are aliens on board
from the surface. They're planting bombs on D deck. You've got to hear
me. The ship is in danger. <br/>
(The comm. chimes) <br/>
ARCHER: Go ahead. <br/>
BAIRD [OC]: We've located her father, sir. The mother isn't home. <br/>
ARCHER: What time is it there? <br/>
BAIRD [OC]: Oh nine hundred. <br/>
ARCHER: Put him through. <br/>(He sits down in front of his desk monitor.) <br/>ARCHER: Good
morning, sir. <br/>
SATO [on monitor]: Captain Archer. Is everything all right? <br/>
ARCHER: No sir, everything is not all right. We've had an accident with
our transporting device. <br/>
SATO [on monitor]: Transporting device? What is that? <br/>
HOSHI: You don't have time for this. <br/>
ARCHER: A matter stream converter. It was approved for transporting
bio-matter before we left Earth. <br/>
HOSHI: I'll find something that'll get your attention. <br/>(She starts going
around the room, putting her hand into the bulkheads at various places.)
<br/>
ARCHER: We've used it a number of times to <br/>
SATO [on monitor]: Bio-matter? What are you referring to, produce or
people? <br/>
ARCHER: I'm just trying to explain to you that Star Fleet told us it
was safe. <br/>
SATO [on monitor]: So, Hoshi is safe. <br/>
ARCHER: No, sir. There was an accident. She began to, her molecules
began to destabilise. <br/>
SATO [on monitor]: Her molecules? What are you talking about, Captain? <br/>
ARCHER: This isn't easy, sir. I fought to get Hoshi to come on this
mission. I'm responsible for her being out here. She's, become a member
of our family. <br/>
SATO [on monitor]: Family? We're her family, not you. Why are you
calling me? To say that she has become a member of your family? I'm
sorry, Captain. You are not making any sense. <br/>
(Hoshi finds a conduit that makes a noise when she 'touches' it.) <br/>
ARCHER: We lost Hoshi today, Mister Sato. I wish I didn't have to tell
you that. <br/>
SATO [on monitor]: You are saying Hoshi is dead? <br/>
HOSHI: We're all going to be dead if I don't get him to notice this. <br/>
SATO [on monitor]: Maybe, you could call us back later. This afternoon?
<br/>
HOSHI: How about Morse code? You know Morse Code, don't you? <br/>
SATO [on monitor]: I must have time to speak to Hoshi's mother. <br/>
HOSHI: Come on, listen. <br/>
ARCHER: This afternoon. <br/>
HOSHI: Can you hear it? <br/>
ARCHER: I'm so sorry. <br/>
SATO [on monitor]: So am I. <br/>(Transmission ends.) <br/>
HOSHI: Come on. <br/>(Archer turns his head towards the tiny noises.) <br/>HOSIHI: That's
right. It's not supposed to be making that noise, is it? Listen, you
can hear it. SOS. SOS. It's a call for help. I need you to hear it. <br/>
(Archer sees the indicator light on the ceiling beam flashing in time
to Hoshi's signal.) <br/>
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol. <br/>
T'POL [OC]: Yes, Captain? <br/>
ARCHER: Could you come in here for a minute? <br/>
T'POL [OC]: Right away. <br/>
HOSHI: That's right, show it to her. One of you will figure it out. <br/>
(T'Pol enters.) <br/>
ARCHER: Look at this. I've never heard it make that noise before. <br/>
T'POL: The plasma circuit's being interrupted. I'll ask Commander
Tucker to take a look at it. <br/>
ARCHER: Listen to the pattern. Three dots, three dashes, three dots.
SOS. <br/>
T'POL: Dots? <br/>
ARCHER: Dots and dashes. Morse code. Its been used on Earth for
centuries. It's a distress call. <br/>
HOSHI: Let's see how good your memory is. H, O, <br/>
T'POL: It's changed. <br/>
HOSHI: S, H, <br/>
ARCHER: It still sounds like Morse code. <br/>
HOSHI: I. Come on. <br/>
T'POL: This plasma circuit is self-contained. No one outside of this
room could be using it to send a message. <br/>
HOSHI: I'm not outside this room, I'm right here. <br/>
T'POL: It's been a very difficult day. Perhaps you should try to get
some rest. <br/>
ARCHER: You're right. I'll have Trip look at it tomorrow. <br/>
HOSHI: Tomorrow's too late. They're going to blow up the ship. Captain!<br/>(The aliens have finished planting their devices in the Jefferies,
and are now arming them. Hoshi follows them as they go to Engineering, where she watches through a ventilation grill as
they put devices on the warp core right under the eyes of the unseeing
engineering staff.) </font></p>

hand into one of the bombs and switches it off. All the devices disarm.
The second alien comes in and replaces the damaged unit, and Hoshi
cannot turn this one off. The aliens cannot see her either. Then the
aliens make a bigger device materialise. It's a transporter platform,
and one uses it to leave while the other gets the bombs rearmed.)<br/>
HOSHI: No, wait! <br/>

TUCKER [OC]: What's the problem? <br/>
HOSHI: What? <br/>

HOSHI: What are you talking about? They kidnapped you and Travis. We've
got to stop them. <br/>
REED: Hoshi, the transporter was affected by the storms. I had some
trouble reintegrating your matter stream. <br/>
HOSHI: Trouble? <br/>
TUCKER: You were sort of, trapped in the pattern buffer. But only for a
few seconds. <br/>
REED: Eight point three seconds, to be precise. <br/>
HOSHI: Are you saying that I was just on the surface? <br/>
TUCKER: You insisted on going second. <br/>
HOSHI: Do you have a mirror? <br/>
REED: What? <br/>

all of that happened in eight seconds? <br/>
PHLOX: Actually, it probably happened in the last one or two seconds as
your matter stream was coalescing. She seems fine. <br/>
ARCHER: Malcolm is recommending some new transport protocols to Star
Fleet. He's suggesting we start compressing the transport beam. <br/>
HOSHI: Well, I hope you don't plan on beaming me anywhere for a long
time. <br/>
ARCHER: But you said you stepped on to the aliens' transporter by
choice. <br/>
HOSHI: I was trying to save Enterprise. <br/>
ARCHER: Sounds like you overcame your fear. <br/>
HOSHI: It's all in my head, remember? <br/>
ARCHER: Does it matter? You were afraid of getting lost, afraid of
disappearing, but you still climbed on to that platform, real or not. <br/>

shuttlepods for the time being. <br/>
