exactly the same. <br/>

T'POL: Twenty three biosigns. <br/>
ARCHER: Hail them. This is Captain Jonathan Archer of the starship
Enterprise. Can we assist you? <br/>
D'JAMAT [OC]: Enterprise, we've suffered heavy damage. Our engines are
inoperative, our life support system is failing. Please assist us.<br/>
ARCHER: What kind of weapons do they have? <br/>
REED: Minimal. <br/>
ARCHER: Can you get us through the anomalies? <br/>

MAN: Thank you, Doctor.<br/>
ARCHER: How are they? <br/>
PHLOX: I'm unable to perform detailed bioscans. <br/>
ARCHER: Why? <br/>
PHLOX: They have an aversion to any kind of invasive medical care, for
religious reasons. However, I have managed to ascertain that aside from
some minor injuries and one slight case of malnutrition, they appear to
be fine. <br/>
ARCHER: They're no strangers to anomalies. That looks like an old scar.
<br/>
PHLOX: I found similar injuries on four others. Apparently they've been
in the vicinity of the sphere for several months. <br/>
ARCHER: Which one's the Captain? </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br/>(Phlox indicates D'Jamat, a humanoid with grey hair pulled back into
a ponytail, and a red mark on the right hand side of his face - just

PHLOX: He prefers the term Pri'Nam, a religious
designation.<br/>
ARCHER: I'm Captain Archer. Welcome aboard. <br/>
D'JAMAT: (shaking his hand) My name is D'Jamat. I can't express how
grateful we are. You saved our lives. <br/>
ARCHER: I understand you've been in this region for quite some time. <br/>
D'JAMAT: Yes, we're on a pilgrimage to the twelfth Sphere. It's taken
us a year to make the journey. <br/>
ARCHER: Your ship's in pretty rough shape. My engineer's taking a look
at it. <br/>
D'JAMAT: It's an old vessel, but sturdy. Unfortunately we are better at
prayer than we are at space travel. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe there's some information about the Spheres we can share.
If you're feeling up to it, I'd like you to have dinner with me and my
Science Officer tonight. <br/>
D'JAMAT: I'd be honoured to accept your hospitality, Captain. </font></p>

D'JAMAT: Our home world is called Triannon. It's six point three light
years from here in the Maradas star cluster. Have you heard of it? <br/>
ARCHER: Doesn't ring a bell. We're new to the Expanse. <br/>
D'JAMAT: The Expanse? You mean the Chosen Realm. <br/>
ARCHER: I think we're talking about the same thing. We're here to learn
everything about a species you may have run into, the Xindi? <br/>
D'JAMAT: I'm not familiar with them. We place very little emphasis on
meeting other lifeforms. Space travel for us is merely a means to bring
us closer to the Spheres. <br/>
T'POL: You've studied them for some time? <br/>
D'JAMAT: We're not here to study the Spheres, we're here to venerate
them. We believe that it is through prayer and meditation that the
Makers become manifest. <br/>
ARCHER: The Makers? <br/>
D'JAMAT: The creators of the Spheres. I've felt their presence here.
<br/>(He shows a scar on his arm.)<br/>
T'POL: You're referring to spatial anomalies. <br/>
D'JAMAT: The Maker's Breath. It reshapes reality, allows ordinary men a
glimpse of the divine. <br/>
T'POL: That Breath nearly destroyed your ship. <br/>
D'JAMAT: Well, we became careless. It's easy to do when you're in the
presence of a Sphere. <br/>
ARCHER: They're certainly impressive. We've found three of them so far.
<br/>
D'JAMAT: You're fortunate to have such a fast ship. I regret that I'll
die having seen only one of the many thousands of Spheres. <br/>
T'POL: Actually, we've determined that there are fifty nine Spheres in
the Expanse. <br/>
D'JAMAT: I think your estimates are a bit low. <br/>
T'POL: That's doubtful. <br/>
D'JAMAT: With the Makers there is no doubt. <br/>
T'POL: Doubt is the basis of all scientific progress. <br/>
D'JAMAT: Scientific progress has led many people astray. <br/>
ARCHER: Perhaps this is a subject we should discuss some other time? <br/>
D'JAMAT: I agree, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: You'll be glad to know my engineer believes that he can repair
the damage to your vessel. He thinks it shouldn't take more than a
couple of days. <br/>
D'JAMAT: That is good news. I certainly hope that we'll have the
opportunity to repay your kindness. </font></p>

PHLOX: What is it? Are you feeling ill? <br/>
INDAVA: I wanted to ask you about a certain procedure. I'm sorry, it's
very difficult for me to talk about. <br/>
PHLOX: Why don't you have a seat? I was about to make some Janaran tea.

YARRICK: Yes. They're just waiting for your signal. <br/>
D'JAMAT: You sound hesitant. <br/>
YARRICK: I'm sorry Pri'Nam, but are you certain this is the right thing
to do? <br/>
D'JAMAT: Do you think this ship just came to us by coincidence? This
encounter was clearly ordained by the Makers. <br/>
YARRICK: But these people risked their lives to save us. <br/>
D'JAMAT: They desecrated a Sphere. What we are about to do is not just
for our salvation, but for theirs as well. I know it can be difficult.
We've been away from home for a long time, but we have been given the
means to end the bloodshed for once and for all. Don't lose your faith
now, Yarrick. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ARCHER:
They believe that god-like beings they call the Makers created the
Spheres a thousand years ago. <br/>
T'POL: We have determined that the Spheres are nearly a thousand years
old. <br/>
ARCHER: Well. they also believe that the Makers are using the Spheres
to reshape the Expanse, creating a paradise for when they return. <br/>
T'POL: Mythology often has a basis in fact. <br/>
ARCHER: Come in. <br/>
D'JAMAT: Am I disturbing you? <br/>
ARCHER: Not at all. <br/>
T'POL: Excuse me. <br/>(She leaves.)<br/>
D'JAMAT: I said before that I hoped to be able to repay your kindness. <br/>
ARCHER: That isn't necessary. <br/>
D'JAMAT: It's already underway. Captain Archer, you, your crew, this
vessel, are all about to embark on a glorious mission. At this moment a
number of my people have taken positions around your vessel. Their
bodies have been equipped with powerful organic explosives. With a
single command I can order any one of them to sacrifice their lives.

T'POL: (under armed guard at her station) If you use Enterprise to
attack your enemies you may prevail, but your war will not end. (gets
up and walks over) Vulcan was once torn by violent conflict. Numerous
factions with opposing doctrines on logic. Each decisive victory drove
the defeated faction underground until they could regroup and fight
again. The cycle perpetuated itself for centuries. Only when we
embraced non-violence did we achieve peace. <br/>
D'JAMAT: We also plan to embrace non-violence. As soon as the heretics
are eliminated. <br/>

disagrees with you. <br/>

ARCHER: Where are you taking this ship? <br/>
D'JAMAT: To my homeworld. We'll be there in three days. For the last
century, a violent group of heretics have tried to undermine our way of
life. With your ship I can deliver a final, decisive attack. I can end
this conflict forever. <br/>
ARCHER: A war. That was the glorious mission you were talking about? <br/>
D'JAMAT: I'm trying to save my people. <br/>
ARCHER: Why do I have the feeling these heretics would say the same
thing. <br/>
D'JAMAT: They might very well, but it doesn't change what they are.
Enemies of the truth. <br/>
ARCHER: Your truth. <br/>
D'JAMAT: There's only one. <br/>
ARCHER: How many people do you intend to kill with my ship? <br/>
D'JAMAT: Your species is obsessed with numbers. A characteristic of
your misguided belief that the secrets of the universe can be revealed
through science. This may sound barbaric to you, but it doesn't matter
how many heretics die. When the Makers return, only the faithful will
survive. Non-believers will be swept away. Not only Triannons, but
every race within the Chosen Realm. <br/>
ARCHER: Doctrines like that make it real easy to wipe out everyone who
doesn't agree with you. <br/>
D'JAMAT: You're wrong. It's not easy. If it were, I wouldn't be
dreading what I have to do next. I've been reviewing your records.
You've committed terrible acts of desecration. Not only have you flown
within the cloaking barrier of three Spheres, you've landed on one and
entered another. For crimes of this magnitude my faith obligates me to
destroy your ship and put your crew to death. However, I cannot ignore
the fact that you put yourselves at risk to save us, and that I like
you, Captain. I believe you're an honourable man, so I am going against
what my faith dictates. I'm going to temper the punishment. As
Commander of this ship you may choose one member of your crew to give
up their life. <br/>
ARCHER: You're out of your mind. <br/>
D'JAMAT: If you won't choose, I'll choose for you. I take no pleasure
in this, Captain, believe me. <br/>
ARCHER: I need time to think about this. <br/>
D'JAMAT: You have six hours. I urge you to use this time to search
within yourself, and put these lies out of your mind. All of this data
that you've collected must be erased from existence. (He starts deleting
the sensor files.19.3 XB are gone in seconds) <br/>D'JAMAT: Six hours, Captain. </font></p>

be kept appraised. <br/>
ARCHER: That's very considerate of him. Wait a minute. Your name's
Yarrick, isn't it? <br/>
YARRICK: It is. <br/>
ARCHER: I understand your wife paid a visit to Sickbay. She had a long
talk with my doctor. She's pregnant. <br/>
YARRICK: Yes. <br/>
ARCHER: I guess you also know she wants to end the pregnancy. <br/>
YARRICK: That's between her and me. <br/>
ARCHER: My doctor got the impression that she doesn't exactly agree
with D'Jamat's interpretation of your faith. As a matter of fact, Phlox
said she's grown to hate everything about it. <br/>
YARRICK: That's not true. <br/>
ARCHER: He also got the impression that you're not happy with the way
things are going either. <br/>

D'JAMAT: Enter. Ah, I'm glad you've come. I was just looking at your
Captain's Logs. I had no idea we were such kindred spirits. <br/>
ARCHER: What makes you think that. <br/>
D'JAMAT: I know why you're here, in the Expanse. It turns out we're
both fighting to save our people. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm trying to stop my world from being destroyed. You're trying
to wipe out everyone who doesn't share your beliefs. <br/>
D'JAMAT: Our situations aren't as different as you think. <br/>
ARCHER: I draw the line at murdering innocent people. <br/>
D'JAMAT: And not torture? In your log there is an incident with a
prisoner. An interrogation that made use of an airlock. <br/>
ARCHER: I needed information critical to my mission. He wasn't hurt. <br/>
D'JAMAT: I sympathise with you, Captain. I've had to make hard choices
as well. When I was young, I fought with the Holy Regiments. I was
commanding a mission. We'd infiltrated a village known to be a heretic
stronghold. We were instructed to stay concealed and relay intelligence
about enemy movements, but one of the villagers discovered us. It was a
small boy, no more than six years old. We knew if we let him go he
would alert the village, and if we tried to hold him he might give us
away. There was only one action to take, so I took it. <br/>
ARCHER: You're proud of that. <br/>
D'JAMAT: In the service of the Makers, all actions are blessed ones. <br/>
ARCHER: There are no Makers. At least, not how you perceive them. The
Spheres are machines built for a reason you and I don't understand. <br/>
D'JAMAT: I was once like you, but then I felt the Breath. I prayed for
you, Captain. I had hoped that the Makers would open your eyes to the
truth, but it seems that they've turned away. You had a choice to make.
<br/>
ARCHER: I've made it. <br/>
D'JAMAT: And which crew member have you selected? <br/>
ARCHER: I've chosen myself. You wanted to kill someone, kill me. <br/>
D'JAMAT: I urge you to reconsider. <br/>
ARCHER: I won't make someone else pay for something that happened under
my command. <br/>
D'JAMAT: But what about your mission? When I'm through with your ship,
your crew will need their Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: T'Pol's a fine commander. <br/>
D'JAMAT: We are more alike than you think, Captain. I would make the
same choice. I respect your decision. <br/>
ARCHER: Then maybe you'll grant a request. <br/>
D'JAMAT: What is it. <br/>
ARCHER: My people have certain customs regarding death. There's a
device on board. We use it to dispose of hazardous materials but, on
rare occasions, when the situation arises, we've also used it for
executions. It's considered humane. <br/>

is pulling leads and cables out everywhere.) <br/>
TUCKER: I'm telling you, I didn't do anything. Ask your flunky over
here. He's been looking over my shoulder the whole time. <br/>
NALBIS: It's true. He never left my sight. <br/>
D'JAMAT: This did not happen by accident. <br/>
NALBIS: Pri'Nam, there's something wrong with the EPS manifolds on deck
D, section J15. <br/>
D'JAMAT: Yarrick, go with him. </font></p>

It's on the left. <br/>
ARCHER: You past it. <br/>(Archer shoots him.) <br/>ARCHER: You don't want to do that. <br/>
YARRICK: You can't win. They'll destroy the ship.<br/>
ARCHER: Not if you help me. <br/>
YARRICK: No. <br/>
ARCHER: You know this is wrong. Everything he'd doing, we can put a
stop to it. All of it. <br/>
YARRICK: I won't betray my faith. <br/>
ARCHER: Your faith betrayed you. Is this really what the Makers want?
To kill people by the thousands in their name? Is that the faith you
were raised in? <br/>
YARRICK: No. <br/>
ARCHER: Then do what's right. If you don't help me, you'll be
condemning your wife and child to death, because that's how this is
going to end. As long as people like D'Jamat dictate what's true and
what isn't, all you'll ever have is war. </font></p>

D'JAMAT: Have you located Lyaal? <br/>
JAREB: Internal sensors aren't functioning. Systems are down all over
the ship. <br/>
(Another alarm beeps.) <br/>
D'JAMAT: What is it?<br/>
TRAVIS: There's a convoy of ships approaching. <br/>
D'JAMAT: Let me see them. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ARCHER:
These people you're fighting. What makes them heretics? <br/>
YARRICK: We believe the Makers created the Chosen Realm in nine days.
They believe it took ten. <br/>
ARCHER: For that, you've been at war for over a century? Found it. <br/>
YARRICK: What is it? <br/>
ARCHER: The environmental controls need to be re-routed to Sickbay.
That can only be done from the Bridge. I'm going to show you how to do
it. <br/>
YARRICK: Why? <br/>
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox has synthesised an airborne agent. It neutralises
one of the enzymes used in the organic explosives, renders it inert. </font></p>

CERIS [on viewscreen]: I have four ships. <br/>
D'JAMAT: If you had ten ships you wouldn't survive against this vessel.
Run your scans. You'll see that I'm telling the truth. Surrender and
you'll be treated fairly. <br/>
CERIS [on viewscreen]: You consider us heretics. We know what you do to
them, D'Jamat.<br/>
D'JAMAT: Target the lead vessel. Do what I say. <br/>
T'POL: No. <br/>(She is replaced by Jareb.)<br/>
D'JAMAT: Prepare to fire torpedoes. <br/>(Two hit their target.) <br/>
JAREB: One of the ships has lost engines. <br/>
D'JAMAT: Target their main reactor. <br/>(T'Pol tries to stop him but fails.
The ship is destroyed and a shooting match begins, shaking Enterprise.) </font></p>

YARRICK: Pri'Nam. <br/>
D'JAMAT: It's begun. What's the status of the engines? <br/>
YARRICK: We've located the problem. It's under repair. The warp reactor
should be functioning in a few hours. <br/>
JAREB: They're retreating. <br/>
D'JAMAT: Stay with them. <br/>(He puts a gun to Travis's head.) <br/>D'JAMAT: Do what I say!
(T'Pol nods) Bring us within firing distance. Prepare to lock weapons. <br/>

There's another gun fight, this time in Engineering. Again, a Triannon
discovers the explosive doesn't work anymore.  There's
fisticuffs in a corridor for Reed and Cole. When his phase
rifle runs out of charge. Indava saves Reed's life.)<br/>

crew? <br/>
(Reed and the MACOs enter the Bridge. Naturally, there's a gun battle.
T'Pol takes a weapon from the fallen Jareb and finally takes out
D'Jamat.)<br/>

I had weapons back. <br/>

channel.) <br/>ARCHER: This is Captain Archer. D'Jamat is no longer in control of
this vessel. Please respond. We've retaken the ship. I'm in command
again. <br/>

ARCHER: We just entered orbit around Triannon. Let's go. <br/>
D'JAMAT: You've done a terrible thing, Captain. You've interfered with
something that was ordained. After centuries of fighting, I was going
to bring an end to the war. We would have had peace. <br/>
ARCHER: Peace? One of my crewmen is dead, six others are wounded, my
ship is damaged. <br/>

Millions are dead. Your faith was going to bring peace? Here it is. </font>
