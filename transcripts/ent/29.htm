REED: Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: Sleep well? <br/>

ARCHER: I wasn't sure what you wanted for breakfast, so I took the

discuss something. <br/>
ARCHER: No. No business. I just wanted to have a long overdue meal with
my Armoury Officer. <br/>(Breakfast is served.) <br/>ARCHER: I heard that England made it
to the finals in the World Cup. <br/>

ARCHER: The World Cup? Soccer? <br/>

ARCHER: Any sports you do follow? <br/>
REED: No, not particularly. <br/>
ARCHER: Thanks. <br/>
CREWMAN: You're welcome, sir. <br/>(He leaves.) <br/>
REED: I've been working on the duty roster, sir. We only have two
crewmen assigned to the Armoury full time. If we added a third, Ensign
Tanner would be free to begin those upgrades to those torpedo launchers

uncharted system along our present course. One of the planets is

fresh air. Put us in a standard orbit. <br/>

REED: It's armed with tricobalt explosives. I
think it's a mine. And judging by the firepower, something similar
damaged our ship. <br/>
ARCHER: Can you tell if it's active? <br/>
REED: No reason to believe it's not. <br/>
T'POL: Captain, it's lodged near Impulse Reactor Two. An explosion
anywhere near there could disable Enterprise. <br/>
ARCHER: What if we polarised the adjacent hull plating? <br/>
REED: We don't know how it's triggered. Somebody has to go out there
and defuse it, and it should be me. I have the ordnance training.

ARCHER: I've never heard of a minefield with just two mines. Are the
quantum beacons still mounted on the grappler arm? <br/>
TRAVIS: I believe so. <br/>

the beacon. <br/>

ARCHER: How bad is it? <br/>
TUCKER: I can't really tell until we can get into the decompressed
sections but I imagine it's pretty ugly. I've got one piece of good
news. I did a head count. We didn't lose anyone. <br/>
ARCHER: Trip, I'm not sure Malcolm's going to be able to defuse this
thing. Couldn't we just detach that section of hull plating? Let it
drift away? <br/>
TUCKER: We'd have to reroute some EPS conduits. There's about three hundred bolt
couplings. It could be done. <br/>
ARCHER: How long? <br/>
TUCKER: Three or four hours. But I wouldn't recommend it, sir. We'd be
exposing a good piece of the impulse manifold. <br/>

table. I just wasn't entirely comfortable having a casual meal with my
captain. I was trained not to fraternise with superior officers. <br/>
ARCHER: Never too late to learn. <br/>
REED: Frankly, sir, from my point of view that kind of socialising has
no place on a starship. <br/>
ARCHER: I had a CO once felt the same way. They're your crew, not your
friends. I thought about that a lot when I took this command, but then
I realised this is not your typical mission. We could be out here for
years. All we have to depend on is each other. <br/>
REED: There are two left. Top left first. <br/>
ARCHER: I appreciate your suggestions, Malcolm. Anything else? <br/>
REED: Well, since you asked. Bridge protocols have become somewhat lax.
Too many people offering opinions. We're here to carry out your orders,
sir. You're the Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: What's the point of having a senior staff if they just sit
around with their mouths shut? I'm glad they have opinions. I rely on
them. Keep going. <br/>
REED: And in the area of security I sometimes think you could show a
little more caution, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm aware of your concerns in that area. <br/>
REED: Not to say that it hasn't been a privilege to have served with
you. <br/>
ARCHER: Ah ha. <br/>
REED: Sir? <br/>
ARCHER: You're talking in the past tense, Lieutenant. <br/>(He deactivates the
sixth relay.) <br/>
REED: Now, reinsert all six relays, but in the reverse order. You're
doing fine, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: Thanks. </font></p>

TUCKER: You've earned yourself a break, Travis. Ensign Hutchison can
cover the helm for a while. <br/>
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir, but I'd prefer to stay at my post. <br/>
T'POL: Bridge to Captain Archer. <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Hull]</b> </font></p>

ARCHER: Maintain course and speed. <br/>
T'POL: Understood. <br/>
REED: This last detonation circuit has an added attraction. I'm seeing
something that looks like a back-up arming mechanism. We'll have to
fool the circuit into thinking it's still online. <br/>
ARCHER: How do we do that? <br/>
REED: There's a hyperspanner in the equipment case. Take out its power
cell and strip off the casing. <br/>
ARCHER: You must have realised this wasn't going to be your typical
armory posting. That my command style lacked a certain spit and polish.
<br/>
REED: It was obvious, if you don't mind me saying so. <br/>
ARCHER: Strange. <br/>
REED: What's strange, sir? <br/>
ARCHER: I understand you came from a long line of Royal Navy men. Your
father, your grandfather. Why pick Starfleet? Why not continue the
family tradition? <br/>
REED: God knows I tried. <br/>
ARCHER: What happened? <br/>
REED: I'll need a circuit probe. <br/>
ARCHER: So, what happened? <br/>
REED: (working on the power cell) I was raised on the water. I knew how
to handle a boat before I could ride a bicycle. Studied all the great
naval battles. I don't know. I suppose I thought I'd just grow out of
it. <br/>
ARCHER: Grow out of what? <br/>
REED: Aquaphobia. <br/>
ARCHER: You're afraid of the water? <br/>
REED: More precisely, afraid of drowning. <br/>
ARCHER: So instead of a life on the sea you chose a life in the vacuum
of space? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Archer goes back to the mine with the power cell.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
REED: I had a
great-uncle who suffered from the same problem, but he faced his fears.
Joined the Navy, had a distinguished career. All you have to do is
attach it to the cylinder on your upper right. It's working. Start with
the topmost component. Use the caliper to lift it a few millimetres and
then turn it clockwise three hundred and sixty degrees, and then gently
reinsert it. He was something of a hero to me, my great-uncle. <br/></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Archer does as he's told.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
ARCHER: The one with aquaphobia? <br/>
REED: Indeed. He signed up with the submarine service. <br/>
ARCHER: Talk about facing your deepest fears. <br/>
REED: He was a brave man. Wasn't long before he'd worked his way up
through the ranks. Made chief engineer on the HMS Clement. Do you know
the story of the Clement, sir? <br/>
ARCHER: I don't think I do. <br/>(He completes disarming that segment of the
mine.) <br/>
REED: Good. Now, the other five components. Repeat the same process on
each one, counterclockwise. <br/>
ARCHER: You were telling me about the Clement. <br/>
REED: They were on a routine patrol when they had an accident. Now,
there's a beautiful irony for you. They hit a mine left over from some
world war. There they were, trapped underneath an ice shelf, several
compartments flooding, including Engineering. Can you imagine? My
great-uncle, the man afraid of drowning? The ship was sinking, losing
power. According to his lieutenant, my great-uncle sealed himself in
the engine room and kept the reactor online long enough for his crew to
make it to the escape pods. He went down with his ship. He did what he
had to do to save his crewmates. <br/>
ARCHER: I appreciate what you're trying to tell me, Malcolm, but I was
hoping you'd be able to save your heroics for another time. <br/>
REED: I just want you to know, sir, that I am prepared. <br/>
ARCHER: Got you. <br/>
REED: If we're not able to defuse this mine, the safety of the crew <br/>
ARCHER: I said I heard you, Lieutenant. <br/>
REED: I'm afraid we have another problem, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: What? What is it? <br/>
REED: I need to use the bathroom. <br/>
ARCHER: I won't tell a soul. <br/>
REED: In my EV suit, sir? <br/>(Laughter fades as two Romulan warbirds
decloak.) <br/>REED: Sir. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TRAVIS: We're being hailed. <br/>
ROMULAN [OC]: You've ignored our warnings. <br/>
T'POL: We were unable to translate your language until a short time
ago. We're trying to defuse a weapon lodged on our hull. <br/>
ROMULAN [OC]: I'm well aware of your situation. Our scans show you're
prepared to detach the hull segment surrounding the mine. Complete the
procedure and leave this system immediately. <br/>
TUCKER: We've got a man trapped out there. Don't your scans show you
that? <br/>
ROMULAN [OC]: One crewman. You have eighty two others safely aboard.
Jettison the hull segment and leave. We will not tolerate espionage.
<br/>(The ships recloak.) <br/>
ARCHER [OC]: T'Pol, report. <br/>
T'POL: They're demanding that we jettison the section of hull plating
and leave. <br/>
TUCKER: They scanned us, Captain. They know we're ready to detach it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: I'm defusing the last detonation circuit.
Stand by. (a large section starts rising from the top of the mine) <br/>
REED: It's rearming! Reset that last component! Quickly! <br/>
ARCHER: (he does) Lieutenant? <br/>
REED: When you deactivated that final circuit, it triggered a sub
detonator. <br/>
ARCHER: How can we get to it? <br/>
REED: We can't. It's too deep inside. We'd have to dismantle the entire
mine. Captain? Those heroics we spoke about. I think it may be time.
You've done all you can, sir. For what it's worth, you'd make a fine
Armoury Officer. <br/>
ARCHER: Show me that sub-detonator. <br/>
REED: I'd prefer a burial at sea, if I'm not completely vaporised. <br/>
ARCHER: I thought you were afraid of the water. Your scanner,
Lieutenant. <br/>
REED: (handing it over) I told you, sir. There's nothing we can do. <br/>
ARCHER: We'll dismantle this thing piece by piece if we have to. <br/>
REED: That'll take days. <br/>
ARCHER: My schedule's open. <br/>
REED: And these Romulans? They don't seem like the patient types. The
longer we stay in this system, the more likely they're going to attack.
As much as I appreciate all your efforts, you have to detach the hull
plating. It's the only option. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm not about to leave one of my crew behind. <br/>
REED: You're putting Enterprise at risk. <br/>
ARCHER: We're wasting time. Help me figure out a way to get you off of
here. That's an order. <br/>(Reed disconnects his air hose.) <br/>ARCHER: What the hell
are you doing? <br/>(He lets the scanner float away as he goes to reconnect it,
then sees Reed has almost zero air left now.) <br/>ARCHER: Great. <br/>(He connects his own
air supply to Reed's.) <br/>ARCHER: If I were the kind of captain you think I should
be, I'd bust your ass back to crewman. <br/>
REED: Begging your pardon, sir, but if you were that kind of captain we
wouldn't be having this conversation. You'd have cut me loose by now. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm not going to do that, Malcolm. When we triggered that sub-detonator, why didn't the mine explode right away? <br/>(He disconnects the
replenishment hose.) <br/>ARCHER: How many seconds went by before I rearmed it? <br/>
REED: Sir? <br/>
ARCHER: How many seconds? <br/>
REED: I don't remember. Ten, maybe twelve. <br/>
ARCHER: It felt more like twenty. <br/>
REED: Ten, twenty, what's the difference? <br/>
ARCHER: If it had exploded, how big would the yield have been? <br/>
REED: Judging by the damage the first mine caused, I'd guess about a
quarter of a kiloton. What are you getting at, sir? </font></p>

there? <br/>

T'POL: I'm sure you did everything you could, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm going with him. Can a shuttle pod hatch withstand a
quarter-kiloton blast? <br/>
TUCKER: Depends how close it was. <br/>
ARCHER: Twenty metres, maybe twenty five. <br/>
TUCKER: They're reinforced with duratanium alloy. They can take a hell
of a beating. What have you got in mind? <br/>

double. <br/>
