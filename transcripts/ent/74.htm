ARCHER: You know about the alien we found, the test subject? <br/>
DANIELS: He belongs to the same race that built the Spheres. They're
altering this space to make it habitable for their species. You have to
make the Xindi understand that humanity isn't the enemy. <br/>

ARCHER </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[Ready room]</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">: We're
destined to form an alliance to stop them. <br/>

me they'll have no choice but to take us seriously. <br/>

completion. <br/>
PRESAGE: The timelines don't support that assessment. <br/>
PRIMARY: What have you seen? <br/>
PRESAGE: The number of lines with favourable outcomes has diminished.
There is now an increased chance the Earth ship will prevent the weapon
from being launched. <br/>
BUILDER: Not necessarily. Timelines are sensitive. They're prone to
temporary fluctuations. <br/>
PRESAGE: This is no fluctuation. This is a trajectory away from our
desired outcome. <br/>
PRIMARY: See that you take definitive actions to correct this. The
weapon must be launched. Earth must be destroyed. </font></p>

PHLOX: There isn't anyone on the ship who hasn't been affected by
recent events. What can I do for you? <br/>
TUCKER: I think I pulled a muscle. <br/>

TUCKER:  Pain's pretty bad. <br/>
PHLOX: Have a seat. <br/>
TUCKER: We've been running double shifts in Engineering. Captain's in
hell of a rush to get to this damned Council. <br/>
PHLOX: He believes he can get the Xindi to reconsider their attack on
Earth. We owe him a little faith. <br/>
TUCKER: Oh, I have faith in the Captain, but not in the people he's
trying to convince. <br/>
PHLOX: Degra seems to be a reasonable man. <br/>

would go along with that. <br/>

artificial intelligence. This section houses the redundant memory core.
It should contain a significant amount of information. <br/>
ARCHER: We're hoping that'll include data on the Sphere Builders. <br/>
DEGRA: That could help us with the Council. <br/>
T'POL: Our present course will take us close to another Sphere. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm sending a crew in a shuttlepod. They'll join up with us
later. <br/>
DEGRA: How do you plan to get inside it? <br/>
ARCHER: We're pretty sure we've found a way in. You've mentioned the
Xindi have been studying the Spheres for decades. <br/>
T'POL: We're interested in any information you have on the construction
of their outer shells. <br/>

DEGRA: What do you want? <br/>
BUILDER: You've turned away from us. Come back. <br/>
DEGRA: I can't. <br/>
BUILDER: I hear it in your voice. You have betrayed everything you
believe in and now you're in turmoil. <br/>
DEGRA: I don't regret what I'm doing. <br/>
BUILDER: At one time or another you must have asked yourself why we've
protected the Xindi for so long. <br/>
DEGRA: Many of us have wondered that. <br/>
BUILDER: It's because we can see a future where the Xindi are no longer
fragmented, no longer struggling for existence. You are destined to
become a great civilisation, and now it's all in jeopardy because of
you. <br/>
DEGRA: No. <br/>
BUILDER: You created a device that will prevent a devastating attack.
Your name was to be spoken with reverence for generations to come, and
instead you have chosen the role of betrayer. <br/>
DEGRA: How I'm remembered isn't for you to decide. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DEGRA: The Sphere Builders have lied to the Xindi.
They've manipulated us for decades. I see that. Perhaps the arboreals
will, and the others. <br/>
ARCHER: We have the evidence to back it up. <br/>
DEGRA: The evidence may not be enough. The Sphere Builders saved the
Xindi from extinction. When our home world was destroyed they began
appearing to the survivors. They'd guide them to habitable planets,
show them the location of valuable resources. They're practically
worshipped. We call them the Guardians. <br/>
ARCHER: It's no wonder you had a hard time accepting this. <br/>
DEGRA: I was brought up to revere them. I taught my own children to
give thanks to them at the end of each day. That is what we're facing. <br/>
ARCHER: I've stood before a Klingon tribunal. I can handle a tough
room. <br/>
DEGRA: The Klingons weren't determined to destroy your world. But the
evidence is strong, perhaps it will be enough. We'll face the Council
together. I may take my seat at the Council table, but I'll be at your
side no matter what happens. <br/>
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer. <br/>
ARCHER: Go ahead. <br/>
HOSHI [OC]: We've picked up several Xindi vessels. They're closing on
our position. <br/>
DEGRA: Humanoids, arboreals and aquatics. They're with us. When we
reach the Council's location we'll need their protection. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DEGRA: Certain members have more influence than
others. <br/>
ARCHER: Anything you can tell me about them. I need to know what I'm up
against. <br/>
DEGRA: You know Jannar, the arboreal. He's fair-minded, a scientist,
he'll listen to the facts. I count him as a friend. Unfortunately the
other members are somewhat more complicated. The aquatics for instance.
Kiaphet Amman'sor is a member of the Ibix dynasty, a very wealthy, very
powerful family. Her opinions carry considerable weight when she
arrives at them. There's a saying. It's easier to count the stars in
the sky than it is for an aquatic to reach a decision. As for the
insectoids, well, their names grow longer the older they get, so they
become a little difficult to pronounce. In many ways insectoids are the
opposite of the aquatics. <br/>
ARCHER: They're quick to take sides. We've run into them. <br/>
DEGRA: Which brings us to the reptilians, and Commander Dolim. There's
a story about him. I don't know if it's true, I'd like to believe it
isn't. His daughter gave birth to a son. He had a deformity in his
right arm, not life-threatening but enough to preclude his ever joining
the military. Commander Dolim had his own grandson poisoned. <br/>
ARCHER: From what I've seen that's not hard to believe. <br/>
DEGRA: As I said, it may be just a story, but as a father it's always
in the back of my mind whenever I have dealings with him. </font></p>

Degra. <br/>

SOLDIER: Seven light years from here, within the cloaking barrier of a
Sphere. <br/>
DOLIM: I want to know how it was destroyed. Begin an analysis. <br/>

attacked. <br/>

They view hushed tones with suspicion. <br/>

HOSHI: He said, the Guardians have never lied to us. <br/>
ARCHER: The Guardians built the Spheres. They're reconfiguring the
Expanse, preparing it for colonisation. <br/>
DOLIM: You reek of desperation. You would say anything to save your
world, as evidenced by this manufactured data. <br/>
DEGRA: It's the truth. The data is accurate. Anyone with an objective
eye will come to the same conclusion. <br/>

humans has corrupted your judgment. <br/>

discuss the human's claims. <br/>
HUMANOID: Agreed. We need to return to the subject at hand. <br/>

danger. If you wipe out mankind you'll be destroying yourself. <br/>

Builders. They know this. That's why they manipulated you into
attacking us. <br/>

JANNAR: The Guardians addressed the Council. They presented what they
claimed was a visual record taken from the future. <br/>

DOLIM: The weapon's well guarded. The casualties on both sides would be
heavy. We'd be risking civil war. <br/>

Reptilians will preside over a stronger unified Xindi empire. We will
guarantee Reptilian dominance if humankind is eradicated. <br/>

ARCHER: The Sphere Builders, the beings you call the Guardians, are the

DOLIM: Have you manufactured more data to support this claim? <br/>
ARCHER: A few weeks ago we came across an alien. He was adrift in what
we believe was a transdimensional disturbance. The alien was inside a
pod which was constructed of the same combination of alloys that make
up the outer shell of the Spheres. He was a Sphere Builder. <br/>
HOSHI: (translating aquatic) You've already presented this information.

ARCHER: Not all of it. Energise. <br/>

appears to have a body inside it.) <br/>
JANNAR: Your data states that this alien disintegrated when it came
into contact with our universe. <br/>
ARCHER: He did. <br/>
DEGRA: What you're seeing is a biometric hologram. It's the same
technology used to train our physicians. It was constructed from
medical data collected by Enterprise's medical doctor. <br/>

this phantom wasn't falsified. <br/>
