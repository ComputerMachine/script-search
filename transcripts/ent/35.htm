T'POL [OC]: Science officer's log, August 14, 2152. Enterprise remains
on course for the trinary system. I've transmitted a distress call but
the nearest Vulcan ship is more than nine days away. By the time they
arrive, they may only find debris, if that. Even if Enterprise makes it
past the black hole without being destroyed, it seems likely the crew
won't survive. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[T'Pol's quarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: I'm continuing my analysis of the condition
that's stricken the crew. Without Doctor Phlox's assistance I'm not
hopeful about reversing its effects. I'm documenting my findings so
that Starfleet will at least have a record of what happened. The
symptoms began not long after we set a course for the trinary system.
That was nearly two days ago. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: You're sure it's a black hole? <br/>
T'POL: A class four. <br/>
ARCHER: According to the Vulcan star charts, your people have surveyed
more than two thousand of these things. <br/>
T'POL: That's correct, but none of them were part of a trinary star
system. <br/>
ARCHER: How close can we get? <br/>
T'POL: The gravitational shear between the stars is extreme. We'd have
to drop to impulse, but we should be able to approach to within five
million kilometres. <br/>
TUCKER: Close enough to get some nice pictures. <br/>
ARCHER: How long would it take to reach the system at impulse? <br/>
T'POL: Two days. <br/>
ARCHER: Set a course. <br/>(T'Pol leaves them.) <br/>ARCHER: Trip. If you've got some free
time, I'd love it if you take a look at my chair. <br/>
TUCKER: Sir? <br/>
ARCHER: The Captain's chair. <br/>
TUCKER: Wh-What about it? <br/>
ARCHER:: You may have noticed that I don't sit in it very much. <br/>
TUCKER: Is there a problem? <br/>
ARCHER: It's uncomfortable. When I lean back I feel like I'm about to
slide out of it. I have to sort of perch on the edge. <br/>
TUCKER: I always assumed it was the best seat in the house. <br/>
ARCHER: Take a look at it for me? <br/>
TUCKER: I was going to purge the impulse manifolds. <br/>
ARCHER: The chair first, if you don't mind. <br/>

Archer, Jonathan Archer's father.) <br/>
ARCHER: Come in. <br/>
T'POL: Good morning. <br/>
ARCHER: Morning. <br/>
T'POL: Am I interrupting? <br/>
ARCHER: No, no. Just thinking about something. <br/>
T'POL: Today's duty roster. <br/>(She hands over a PADD.) <br/>
ARCHER: Thanks. <br/>
T'POL: Lieutenant Reed has a new security protocol he'd like to discuss
with you. <br/>
ARCHER: I'll drop by the Armoury. Anything else? <br/>
T'POL: Chef didn't report for duty this morning. He's ill. <br/>
ARCHER: Is it serious? <br/>
T'POL: Doctor Phlox said it's a simple virus. He should be fine after a
few days' rest. Ensign Sato has offered to take charge of the mess
hall. Apparently, she spends some of her free time in the Galley and is
eager for an opportunity to cook for the crew. <br/>
ARCHER: If it's all right with Chef. Let me ask you a question. I
received a manuscript from Earth. A biography of my father. I've been
asked to write the preface. Would you mind reading it when I'm done? <br/>
T'POL: I'd be happy to. <br/>
ARCHER: If I can ever get it finished. I've been putting it off for
weeks. <br/>
T'POL: The next two days should provide you with ample opportunity. <br/>
ARCHER: It's not that I haven't had the time. They only asked for a
page. How am I supposed to sum up my father's life in a page? It
would've been easier if they'd asked me to write the book. <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps by focusing on one incident, a single event that
exemplifies your relationship with your father, you'll be able to
condense your thoughts. <br/>
ARCHER: A logical approach. Maybe you'd like to write it for me? <br/>
T'POL: I'm hardly qualified. </font></p>

we picked up on Risa. <br/>
HOSHI: The orange spinach? <br/>
CUNNINGHAM: He's convinced there's a way to make it edible. <br/>
HOSHI: Why don't we let him tackle that when he gets back? I have
something else in mind. <br/>(She calls up an oriental recipe on the monitor.)
<br/>HOSHI: It's one of my grandmother's specialties. The recipe's been passed down
for generations. <br/>
CUNNINGHAM: I'll need a translation before I can programme the protein
resequencer. <br/>
HOSHI: Oh no. You can resequence all the chicken and potatoes you want,

PHLOX: Ensign. Is there something I can do for you? <br/>
TRAVIS: I've got a little headache. Nothing serious. <br/>
PHLOX: Why don't you let me have a look? <br/>
TRAVIS: I was hoping you could just give me something. I'm right in the
middle of upgrading the navigation sensors. <br/>
PHLOX: It would be irresponsible to dispense medication without
examining you first. Please. Any other symptoms? Dizziness, blurred
vision? <br/>
TRAVIS: No. <br/>
PHLOX: How long have you had it? <br/>
TRAVIS: A couple of days, on and off. <br/>
PHLOX: Well, I've been meaning to have you drop by Sickbay in any
case, to see if you've had any problems since I removed the neural
implants you received at the repair station. <br/>
TRAVIS: You think it could have something to do with that? <br/>
PHLOX: Oh, I never rule out anything. Then again, it could be as
innocuous as muscular tension. On the other hand, Terrellian plague
starts out with a simple headache, then all manner of nasty things
begin to happen. </font></p>

<br/>
T'POL: (raising her voice) Commander. <br/>(He turns off the drill.) <br/>T'POL: Perhaps
you could finish that later. <br/>
TUCKER: This may not be as glamorous as a black hole, but the Captain
gave me an order. <br/>
T'POL: He also requested detailed sensor readings of this trinary
system. <br/>
TUCKER: I thought Vulcans had all this mental focus and discipline. <br/>
T'POL: We also have sensitive hearing. <br/>(Tucker resumes drilling and my

don't want a torpedo mistaking one of our own nacelles for an enemy
vessel. <br/>
ARCHER: You asked to see me, Malcolm? <br/>
REED: I would have come to you, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: It's no problem. What's on your mind? <br/>
REED: I've been reviewing our encounters with hostile species. The
crew's response has been admirable but I feel we can do better, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: And you have a proposal? <br/>
REED: I've been thinking about a ship wide emergency alert. Something a
bit more comprehensive than battle stations. We're taking far too long
to react to potential threats. With a single order from you, or an
impact to the hull, the plating could be polarised, weapons brought
online, critical systems secured. <br/>
ARCHER: I appreciate your concern, Malcolm, but this isn't a warship. <br/>
REED: That's obvious, sir. During our last run-in with the Suliban we
were unprepared for their boarding parties. When the Mazarites attacked
they disabled our aft sensors with their first shot. The list goes on.
<br/>(He hands over a PADD.) <br/>
ARCHER: I can see that. Run this by the senior officers, get some
feedback, and we'll talk again. <br/>

less aggressive. </font></p>

TUCKER: Do you think a cup holder's too much? <br/>

TUCKER: For the Captain's chair. He just wanted the seat adjusted but I
figured as long as I'm working on it. <br/>
REED: Just what the captain needs in a crisis, a place to rest his
beverage. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm also upgrading the status displays. He'll be able to access
tactical data from the armrest. <br/>
REED: If you really want to improve tactical readiness, why don't you
help me with this protocol? <br/>
TUCKER: I'm a little busy right now, Malcolm. <br/>

wrong. What's the most critical component on this ship? The main
computer? The warp reactor? Uh-uh, it's the crew. And the most
important member of the crew is the Captain. He makes life and death
decisions every day and the last thing he needs to be thinking in a

don't know anything about writing. <br/>
TUCKER: I'm not the only one. <br/>(Archer storms out.) </font></p>

just senior officers. <br/>
T'POL: All I requested was a bowl of Plomeek broth. <br/>
HOSHI: I don't have time for special orders. Anyway, you'll like this
better. <br/>
ARCHER: Where's lunch? <br/>
HOSHI: It'll be ready in one minute, sir. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't have a minute. <br/>
HOSHI: If you're so hungry, fix yourself a sandwich. <br/>

help himself.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
HOSHI: That is a very complex recipe. I will not serve it till
it's just right. My family's reputation is at stake. <br/>

REED [OC]: This is a Tactical Alert. All hands report to your stations.
I repeat, this is a Tactical Alert. </font></p>

REED: The crew's response was
unacceptable. Thirty eight percent of them failed to report to their
stations. Critical systems haven't been secured. I haven't even heard
from Engineering. <br/>
ARCHER: Shut off that damn noise. Shut it off. I don't recall
authorising a tactical drill. <br/>
REED: It wouldn't be much of a drill if everybody knew about it, sir.
One minute and fifteen seconds. <br/>
ARCHER: What? <br/>
REED: It took you one minute and fifteen seconds to reach your post.
I'd expect more of our Commanding Officer given that the crew just
might follow his example. <br/>
TUCKER: Captain. <br/>
REED: One minute and forty nine seconds. <br/>

chair on the central display.) <br/>
TUCKER: Interactive status displays, secondary helm control. It's even
got inertial micro-dampers. The ship could be shaking apart and you'd
hardly feel a thing. <br/>
REED: You ignored a tactical alert for this? <br/>
TUCKER: I want to run some colours by you for the headrest. <br/>
REED: This is all a big joke to you. <br/>
TUCKER: Give it a rest. <br/>
REED: This isn't a bloody pleasure cruise. Without proper discipline on
this ship, this mission is doomed. <br/>
TUCKER: Why don't you go play soldier somewhere else? <br/>
(Archer becomes engrossed in his preface again.) <br/>
REED: If this were a military situation you'd be taken out and shot. <br/>
(Tucker grabs Reed and pushes him up against the bulkhead. Archer has
to break them up.) <br/>
ARCHER: Hey, hey, hey, hey. <br/>(He shoves Tucker against the bulkhead himself.)
<br/>ARCHER: I don't care what colour the headrest is, or whether it can serve me
iced tea. I just want a place to sit when I'm on duty. <br/>(Then he does the
same to Reed.) <br/>ARCHER: And if I hear that alarm one more time I may have you
taken out and shot. (to T'Pol) Unless there's a real emergency, like a
reactor breach, I don't want to be disturbed. </font></p>

ARCHER: Go away. <br/>(T'Pol comes in anyway.) <br/>ARCHER: Do I have to start locking my
door? <br/>
T'POL: You said to interrupt you if there was an emergency. I believe
there is. <br/>
ARCHER: Is that right? <br/>(he goes over to the monitor, which shows the words
he read to Tucker earlier.) <br/>
T'POL: The crew's behaviour has become erratic. Even by human
standards, they've grown distracted. Everyone I've encountered appears
to be preoccupied with trivial matters. Ensign Sato's recipe, for
example. Your preface. We should declare a medical emergency and have
Doctor Phlox examine the crew. I suggest he begin with you. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm busy. <br/>
T'POL: Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: Dismissed. <br/>
T'POL: Your crew is in danger. <br/>
ARCHER: I gave you an order. <br/>
T'POL: Captain. <br/>

quarters, until, until a Vulcan ship can come and get you. <br/>(He manhandles

strapped to a table.) <br/>
PHLOX: You're just in time, Sub-Commander. There's a surgical gown in
the compartment by the microscope. This is a rare opportunity to
explore the human brain. <br/>
T'POL: Was he injured? <br/>
PHLOX: A headache. At first, I thought it was a simple vascular
dilation but then I discovered a chemical imbalance in his prefrontal
cortex. I'm going to begin by extracting the first twelve millimetres
of his parietal lobe. A sub-cellular analysis of the tissue should shed
some light on the mystery. <br/>
T'POL: Doctor, you may want to delay the procedure. We have a larger
problem. The entire crew is ill. <br/>
PHLOX: They'll have to wait. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(T'Pol stops him from cutting into Travis's head.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
T'POL: You've been
affected, as well. <br/>
PHLOX: Please remove your hand. <br/>(He moves his fingers so the laser scalpel
is pointing at her eye.) <br/>PHLOX: I won't ask you again. (she lets go) I'll let
you know when I've completed the surgery. <br/>

study Travis's brain scans.) </font></p>

T'POL [OC]: The crew's bio-signs were growing erratic. I began to doubt
any of them would survive more than a few hours. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> T'POL: (continuing to dictate her log) Ironically,
Dr. Phlox's obsession with Ensign Mayweather's headache has provided
some useful data. His cerebral scans have helped me determine that the
radiation coming from the trinary system is causing (a computer alert
sounds) Computer, pause. <br/>(A scan of the star's radiation fields comes
up.) <br/>T'POL: Computer, resume log. My radiometric analysis is complete. As I
suspected, reversing course won't take us out of danger quickly enough.
The radiation appears to extend outward at least half a light year in
every direction except one. If I can chart a course between the stars
we could escape the radiation before the crew succumbs. But I won't be
able to pilot the ship alone. </font></p>

ARCHER: What are you doing? <br/>
T'POL: Your crew may be dying. <br/>
ARCHER: What? <br/>
T'POL: Do you remember that trinary star system? <br/>
ARCHER: The one with the black hole? <br/>
T'POL: It's emitting a dangerous form of radiation. It's affecting your
prefrontal cortex. <br/>(She gets him into his shower cubicle.) <br/>T'POL: I believe that's
why you and the crew have been exhibiting obsessive behaviour. Some of
the crew's biosigns are already unstable. If you're exposed to the
radiation much longer you won't survive. <br/>(She props him against the wall,
gets out and turns on the cold water.) <br/>T'POL: Do you understand what I'm
telling you? <br/>
ARCHER: Turn it off. <br/>
T'POL: Do you understand? <br/>
ARCHER: Yes. Radiation. Tell Phlox, if the the crew's sick. Tell Phlox.
<br/>
T'POL: He's been affected as well. <br/>
ARCHER: But not you? <br/>
T'POL: Vulcan physiology seems to be immune. <br/>
ARCHER: Bring us about. Turn the ship around. <br/>
(She turns the water off and gets him a towel.) <br/>
T'POL: It's not that simple. If we go back the way we came we'll spend
two more days in the radiation field. I've charted a course that'll
have us clear of the radiation in less than seventeen minutes. <br/>
(T'Pol pours him coffee from a thermos that was on his desk.) <br/>
ARCHER: Lousy coffee. <br/>
T'POL: But we'll have to pass within two million kilometres of the
black hole. There's considerable debris and gravitational shear.
Someone needs to pilot Enterprise while I determine the course
corrections. <br/>
ARCHER: Travis. <br/>
T'POL: He's been sedated. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm in no condition to fly a starship. <br/>
T'POL: We have no other choice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Enterprise sails serenely through gas and
boulders as Reed sleeps at his post.) <br/>
T'POL: More gravitational shear. We're too far to port. <br/>
ARCHER: (at the helm) But you said bearing two point four. <br/>
T'POL: Twelve point four. <br/>
ARCHER: My mistake. Twelve point four. <br/>(There's a lot of juddering
feedback from the joystick.) <br/>ARCHER: How much longer is this going to take? <br/>
T'POL: Six minutes. <br/>
ARCHER: I'm good for that. <br/>
T'POL: Another shear front. We need to rotate our longitudinal axis by
twelve degrees and bring our flight vector to zero one four mark two
seven. <br/>
ARCHER: Hold on, hold on. Zero what? <br/>
T'POL: Zero one four mark. <br/>
ARCHER: Mark two-seven. <br/>
(The hull echoes as boulders bounce off it.) <br/>
T'POL: Just minor debris. The hull plating is holding. Our lateral
vector is drifting. Captain! <br/>
ARCHER: Hang on a second. I feel like I'm in flight school again. <br/>
T'POL: You're doing well. New heading. Zero zero six mark four. <br/>(A huge
lump of rock drifts into their path.) <br/>T'POL: Captain! <br/>
ARCHER: I see it. <br/>(The rock shatters as they approach.) <br/>ARCHER: We need phase
cannons. <br/>
T'POL: They'd take too long to charge. <br/>(A big hit, and the alert klaxon
sounds.) <br/>T'POL: All weapons are online. It must be part of the new security
protocol. <br/>
ARCHER: Fire! <br/>(Two shots clear their path of danger.) <br/>ARCHER: Could you shut
that off? <br/>(The klaxon stops.) <br/>ARCHEHR: How much longer? <br/>
T'POL: Less than ten seconds. Five more seconds. <br/>

TRAVIS: Captain. <br/>(Travis leaves.) <br/>
ARCHER: How's the crew? <br/>
PHLOX: Oh, I'm continuing to monitor vital signs. But I've detected no
lingering effects from the radiation. Mostly just rattled nerves, a few
bruises and sprains from when some of them lost consciousness. I
appreciate your intervening before I got any further with Mister
Mayweather's procedure. <br/>
T'POL: I wasn't certain it would work on a Denobulan. <br/>
PHLOX: It worked quite effectively, I can assure you. <br/>
