I talked with Chef at dinner. He's a little worried about the crew.
People are skipping meals. He figures they're either too busy or the
stress of this mission is starting to get to them. <br/>
ARCHER: I haven't had much of an appetite myself. <br/>
TUCKER: Movie night's been on hold since we entered the Expanse. Maybe
we should start it up again? <br/>
ARCHER: There'll be plenty of time for movies after we've dealt with
the Xindi. <br/>
TUCKER: No one hates the Xindi more than I do, Captain, but I'm telling
you this crew needs a little R and R. Unless you want Phlox to start
medicating people, we gotta, we've gotta find a way to boost morale. <br/>
ARCHER: What did you have in mind? <br/>
TUCKER: I was thinking about a comedy. One of the classic Hope and
Crosby pictures. <br/>
ARCHER: Good choice. <br/>
T'POL: Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: We've been reviewing some of these Xindi star charts. Trip
thought they might be able to help us figure out if there are any more
spatial anomalies in the region. <br/>
T'POL: I would have helped you do that. <br/>
ARCHER: It's late. I didn't want to get you out of bed. Besides, our
resident insomniac was looking for something to do. <br/>
TUCKER: You have plans Tuesday night? <br/>
T'POL: Not at the moment. <br/>
TUCKER: Mess hall, nineteen hundred hours. <br/>

HOSHI: Three point two light years, bearing oh one six mark twelve. <br/>
T'POL: I recognise the transponder frequency. It's the Seleya. They
entered the Expanse nine months ago. <br/>
ARCHER: Keep hailing them. Set a course. <br/>
(They reach a place of erratic, colliding asteroids.) <br/>
T'POL: The asteroids are moving in a chaotic fashion. Their paths are
unpredictable. It may be the result of some spatial anomalies. <br/>
ARCHER: Where's the Vulcan ship? <br/>
T'POL: Approximately two thousand kilometres dead ahead. <br/>
TUCKER: I can guess why they were interested in this field. The
asteroids are loaded with trellium ore. <br/>
ARCHER: It looks a little too crowded in there for Enterprise. Wake up
Mister Reed. Tell him to meet us in the Launch bay. <br/>

ARCHER: How much farther? <br/>
T'POL: Twelve hundred kilometres. I could take the helm if you'd like. <br/>
ARCHER: Maybe on the way back. So what else do you know about the
Seleya? <br/>
T'POL: A great deal. I served on it for over a year. It was my last
assignment before joining the consulate on Earth. I was the deputy
science officer under Captain Voris. <br/>
ARCHER: Any idea what they were doing in the Expanse? <br/>
T'POL: They were attempting to chart the thermobaric perimeter. After
several days they reported that they'd become caught in some kind of
subspace eddy and were being pulled into the Expanse. It was their
final transmission. The Vankaara was sent to find them. You already
know what happened to that crew. <br/>
ARCHER: Let's hope the Seleya fared a little better. <br/>
T'POL: Directly ahead, two hundred metres. <br/>

<br/>(A bulkhead is dropped just in front of the group.) <br/>ARCHER: Is there another way
to the airlock? <br/>
T'POL: No. <br/>(They're attacked from behind.) <br/>T'POL: That way. <br/>
ARCHER: Go. Go on. <br/>(They go up a ladder. Archer's foot is grabbed but
they fight them off and shut the hatch.) <br/>ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
Enterprise respond. <br/>
T'POL: If their comm. system's intact we may be able to contact
Enterprise from the Bridge. <br/>
ARCHER: Where is it? <br/>
T'POL: Seven decks above us. <br/>
REED: Seven. How many Vulcans are on board? <br/>
T'POL: Assuming the entire crew is still alive, one hundred and forty
seven. <br/>
REED: If I'm not mistaken, the launch bay's on this level. Maybe we can
use one of their shuttles. <br/>
T'POL: The bay's depressurised, probably from an asteroid impact. <br/>

have been sealed. <br/>

this crew could turn so violent, when Vulcans aren't supposed to have

The bulkhead controls were severed on deck nine. I've rerouted them
through the auxiliary grid. Mister Reed, are you finished with those
actuator circuits? <br/>
REED: They've all been realigned. <br/>
(T'Pol puts her hand in and gets an electric shock) <br/>
ARCHER: You okay? <br/>
T'POL: What did you do? <br/>
REED: I realigned the circuits, just like you asked me. </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(T'Pol pushes him away roughly.) </font></font></font><br/><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
T'POL: These aren't sequenced correctly. You
overloaded the locking mechanism! <br/>
ARCHER: Then we'll have to try something else. <br/>
T'POL: It's pointless. The circuits are damaged! I should have been
watching him. You didn't want me to see. Now I know what you were doing
in the Command Centre. <br/>
ARCHER: What are you talking about? <br/>
T'POL: The Xindi starcharts. You were analysing them behind my back,
undermining my work. <br/>
ARCHER: No one's trying to sabotage your work. We should all just focus
on getting off this ship safely. <br/>
REED: There might be another way, sir. If we overload the power grid,
it would disrupt the systems all over the ship including the bulkhead
mechanisms. <br/>
T'POL: The warp reactor is unstable as it is. Disrupting main power
could shut down the anti-matter containment. You'd cause a reactor
breach. <br/>
ARCHER: I don't think we have much of a choice. <br/>
T'POL: You want to kill all of us. (pulls out her phase pistol) You
don't trust Vulcans. You never have. <br/>
REED: Sir, that pistol's set to kill. <br/>
ARCHER: Give me the weapon. <br/>
T'POL: Don't think I've forgotten. You blamed us for holding you back,
for undermining your father's work. Now you've decided to take revenge.
(Archer and Reed step forward) I'll fire! <br/>
ARCHER: Listen to me. This is a rescue mission. We're here to save
these people. <br/>
T'POL: You're lying. You want to kill them. <br/>
ARCHER: If that's true, then why would I keep our weapons on stun? It's
not logical. <br/>(She's distracted by a thumping at the door, and he
disarms her.) </font></font></p>

It doesn't make sense. T'Pol and I have been working with trellium for
weeks. She hasn't shown any symptoms. <br/>
PHLOX: I don't imagine she would have. Despite your best efforts, you
weren't able to synthesis it in any significant quantities. The crew of
the Seleya, however, had the misfortune of wandering into an asteroid
field filled with the compound. Trellium-D is a potent neurotoxin to
the Vulcan nervous system. It disrupts the synaptic pathways that allow
them to control emotions. Unfortunately the rate of decay is
accelerating. </font></font></p>

circuits elsewhere.) <br/>ARCHER: Phlox, do you read me? <br/>
PHLOX [OC]: I'm afraid there's nothing we can do for the others.
They've been exposed for too long. The neurological damage is
irreversible. They're dying, Captain. <br/>
T'POL: He's lying. He wants them all to die. <br/>

bulkhead drops again.) </font></font></p>

mending nicely, but it will be a few days before she fully regains
control of her emotions. <br/>

turns out it was trellium that poisoned the Vulcan crew and you. <br/>

habitable planet. <br/>

it happen to Enterprise. <br/>

surprised if the body belonged to the delivery man with the strange
limp. You never did see him leave the house. <br/>
TUCKER: What about the gardener? He was there too. <br/>
PHLOX: Too tall. Even the primitive forensics of the mid-twentieth
century would have determined that. <br/>
