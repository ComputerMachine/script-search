<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NEWSREEL: News On Parade! America and Germany
together in the fight for freedom. In his first visit to the home of
the Brave, the German chancellor received a warm welcome from the Big
Apple! He greeted enthusiastic crowds in Times Square and took in the
view from the top of the Empire State Building. Watch that first step!
Later, the Fuhrer paid a call to Lady Liberty, where he was given the
keys to the city! The whirlwind tour was capped off by a four-hour
speech to city leaders, where the Fuhrer outlined his vision for a
prosperous alliance between Germany and America. Vowing to root out the
parasitic elements that have crippled our economy since 1929 and to
liberate the masses from the grip of financial profiteers, Together, we
will put Americans back to work. Two great nations marching side by
side toward a bold future! <br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GENERAL: Our intelligence sources are convinced
that the American counterattack will be launched within days. It's no
longer a rumour. It's fact. <br/>
VOSK: I assume you're taking the necessary steps. <br/>
(He sees the document in
the General's hands.) <br/>
VOSK: What is that? <br/>
GENERAL: An intelligence briefing. According to this, your squadron
performed flawlessly in recent field tests. <br/>
VOSK: You've been spying on us. <br/>
GENERAL: We're protecting our interests. <br/>
VOSK: I suppose I would've done the same. Tell your Fuhrer he'll
receive the squadron when I deem it ready for deployment. <br/>
GENERAL: This says it is ready for deployment. <br/>
VOSK: With all due respect, your intelligence is flawed. <br/>
GENERAL: We are tired of your stalling! <br/>
VOSK: And I am tired of your threats. <br/>
GENERAL: You and your men have taken an oath to defend Germany! <br/>
VOSK: We take that oath seriously. <br/>
GENERAL: Do you? <br/>
VOSK: You've made certain promises to me as well. <br/>
GENERAL: We've provided everything you've asked for. You'll not receive
a single truckload of additional supplies till you fulfill your part of
the agreement. <br/>
VOSK: General, you might consider what would happen if my weapons were
to fall into the hands of the Allies. Imagine Berlin obliterated by
plasma cannons. <br/>
GENERAL: I should have you arrested for treason. <br/>
VOSK: You are a fool. You think we're equals because I allow you to
participate in this struggle. You fight to control nations. We dominate
entire worlds. We extend our will across time. If your race were to
endure for a million years, you couldn't begin to approach what we've
accomplished. The next time you feel the urge to threaten me, remember
this: I can erase you from history as if you never existed. </font></p>

ARCHER: In a battle with a hostile species. <br/>
ALICIA: There's still war in the future? <br/>
ARCHER: On Earth, between human beings, war has been eliminated. But
the galaxy's a big place, with thousands of species.
Not all of them have the same values we have. <br/>
ALICIA: Spaceships. People from other planets. People from the future?
It's all a little too much for Alicia Travers from Bensonhurst.

lot of people in trouble down there, and I'm not going to just turn my
back on them. But you knew I was going to say that, didn't you? <br/>
ARCHER: I had a feeling. Two of my men are missing. They could be
hiding out,
they might've been taken prisoner. They could be dead. <br/>
ALICIA: We've got eyes on every street corner. I can, I can put a word
out. Archer, with this ship, with all this power, you can help us. You
can help us stop those bastards. <br/>
ARCHER: I know. <br/>

ARCHER: We're going to stop them. That's one of the reasons we're here.
But we're going to do it another way. <br/>
ALICIA: Okay. I guess you know what you're doing. Are you going to
start by sending me down with that dissolver thing? <br/>
ARCHER: Shuttlepods are damaged. The transporter is all we have. <br/>
ALICIA: Archer, you promised me I wouldn't have to go through that

rather not know. </font></p>

KRAUL: Based on the interrogations, I believe the prisoners are not
temporal agents. <br/>
VOSK: I've arrived at the same conclusion. Their technology suggests
they're from a period too early for time travel. <br/>
KRAUL: They don't even seem to know how they got to this century. It's
curious. <br/>
VOSK: Still, I refuse to believe their presence here is an accident. <br/>
(The conduit activates, but it isn't stable and goes bang.) <br/>
SCIENTIST: There's a power surge in one of the power modules. <br/>
VOSK: Run a complete systems scan. Isolate the fault. Our time is
running out. The Germans are becoming impatient. <br/>
KRAUL: Why not give them what they want? <br/>
VOSK: I don't trust these people. I never have. I'm not about to
furnish them with weapons that could be used against us. Return the
prisoners to their holding cell. See that they get medical attention.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REED: I think I've pinpointed where the timeline
changed. Someone assassinated Lenin in 1916. <br/>
ARCHER: Who took his place? <br/>
REED: No one. So without Lenin, the Bolsheviks never gained power.
Russia didn't become Communist, and Germany never considered it a
threat. <br/>
ARCHER: Hitler was able to concentrate on the West. <br/>
REED: After France, Belgium and the Netherlands fell. Hitler quickly
took England and then the eastern United States.
<br/>
T'POL: But Vosk and his men arrived on Earth recently. A few years ago.
<br/>
ARCHER: Then they couldn't have been responsible for the changes that
took place in 1916. <br/>
REED: The police never captured Lenin's assassin. Some bystanders
claimed that the killer vanished into thin air. <br/>
T'POL: Daniels said that different factions in the Temporal War are
changing history throughout the timeline. Maybe this assassin was
working for one of them. <br/>
REED: But I thought we were here to prevent Vosk from starting the
temporal war. <br/>

ARCHER: How? <br/>
VOSK: I wish to discuss something with you. <br/>
ARCHER: Go on. <br/>
VOSK: A species with your level of technology doesn't possess the
capability for time travel. <br/>
ARCHER: We had a little help. <br/>
VOSK: As I suspected. What do you know about me? <br/>
ARCHER: I know that you're trapped here, and that you're trying to get
back to the twenty ninth century. I also know you've made a deal with
the Germans. They're giving you supplies, helping you build a time
machine. <br/>
VOSK: I see I was both right and wrong about you. You're not a temporal
agent. But you're here to do their bidding. <br/>
ARCHER: If you carry out your mission, if you make it back to the
twenty ninth century, you will ignite a war that will devastate the
timeline. <br/>
VOSK: You've only heard one side of the story, Captain. The temporal
agents who sent you here are a tyrannical sect imposing their will on
countless cultures throughout history. <br/>
They enforce the Temporal Accords, preserve the time line. <br/>
VOSK: They manipulate the time line to serve their own needs. If you've
ever dealt with them, then you know they do much more than watch
history unfold. They interfere with events. They have an agenda. <br/>
ARCHER: So do you. <br/>
VOSK: At least I don't hide my intentions. It's true, I don't agree
with the Temporal Accords. I believe that time travel is a technology
no different than your warp drive, to be utilized for the benefit of
all species. Societies, cultures can be improved through careful
manipulation of historical events. <br/>
ARCHER: Who decides what improvements are needed? <br/>
VOSK: I won't be drawn into a philosophical discussion. There's one
simple reason why you should help me, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: And what's that? <br/>
VOSK: I can send you back to your century. <br/>
ARCHER: History's been changed. The century I left will be completely
different. <br/>
VOSK: Once I've defeated the temporal agents, I'll reverse the damage
done to your timeline. Your history will return to the way it was. I'm
severely limited by twentieth century Earth technology. The resources
aboard your ship will greatly accelerate my task. Go back. Reunite with
your crewmen, and consider what I have said. </font></p>

to succeed any more than you do. I'll help you. There is one problem. I

reverting to old methods. The way you handled that Xindi threat was
extremely effective. No doubt it's the reason why Daniels chose you to
stop Vosk. <br/>
