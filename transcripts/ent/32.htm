MAKLII: (orange headband) Is it them? <br/>
TESSIC: (red haired man) I don't know. No. It's not their ship. It's
someone else. <br/>
(as it comes in to land, we see that it is a shuttlepod. Pod 1 to be
exact, and once it is down safely, Archer, T'Pol and Tucker climb out,
wearing desert fatigues, to be met by the two men) <br/>
ARCHER: My name is Captain Archer from the starship Enterprise. We
tried to hail you, but there was no response. <br/>
TESSIC: Our communications are down. <br/>
ARCHER: That must make it difficult to do business. A Kreetassan
merchant told us this was a deuterium facility. <br/>
TESSIC: He was correct. <br/>
TUCKER: Our ship took some damage a few weeks ago. We lost most of our
reserves. <br/>
TESSIC: I'm sorry, but we can't help you. Two of our pumps are offline.
You'll have to return later in the season. <br/>
ARCHER: Our supply will be gone in less than two weeks. <br/>
TESSIC: There's nothing we can do. <br/>
T'POL: Are you certain? You seem to have a large inventory. Our sensors
showed over eighty thousand litres. <br/>
TESSIC: You scanned our tanks? <br/>
ARCHER: I apologise, but when you didn't respond to our hails. You sure
you couldn't spare a few hundred litres? <br/>
TESSIC: We're holding that for someone else. Come back at the end of
the season. I'm sure we'll be able to accommodate you. <br/>(Tessic starts to walk
away.) <br/>
MAKLII: Do you have any experience repairing extraction pumps? <br/>
TUCKER: Not specifically, but I could grab some tools and take a look. <br/>
MAKLII: (to Tessic) We get those pumps operating, we can make our
quota. <br/>
ARCHER: It seems that there might be an opportunity for us to help each
other. <br/>
TESSIC: Follow me. <br/>(Archer and T'Pol do. Tucker returns to the pod for
his tools.) </font>

Q'ELL: I didn't touch anything. I just like to look inside the ships
that come here. <br/>
TUCKER: You should have asked. <br/>
Q'ELL: You might have said no. <br/>
TUCKER: Well, what do you think? <br/>
Q'ELL: Well, it's a little small and your thruster controls are hard to
reach. <br/>
TUCKER: Maybe you need longer arms. <br/>
Q'ELL: How fast can it go? <br/>
TUCKER: She's designed for one quarter impulse, but, I've been able to
squeeze a little more out of her. <br/>

TUCKER: Engineer. Commander Trip Tucker. <br/>
Q'ELL: Q'ell. <br/>
TUCKER: Nice to meet you. <br/>
Q'ELL: Could you teach me how to fly it? I can drive the crawler that
we use to move our drill rigs. <br/>

TESSIC: Two power cells. We need six. <br/>
ARCHER: We can't spare that many. Maybe three. <br/>
TESSIC: Do you have any idea how much labour it takes to refine a litre
of deuterium? <br/>
ARCHER: Actually, no. I'd enjoy seeing how your facility works. <br/>
TESSIC: We have three months of good weather, Captain. Three months to
pump all the deuterium we can before the winter. We don't have time to
give tours. Five power cells for two hundred litres. I can't do any
better. <br/>
E'LIS: Our medical stores are running low. <br/>
ARCHER: Four power cells and whatever medical supplies we can spare. <br/>
TESSIC: All right. But only if you can repair our pumps. <br/>
ARCHER: Commander Tucker and his team will do the best they can. <br/>
TESSIC: I expect you to leave orbit in two days. If the pumps are
working, you'll leave with the deuterium. If not, you'll leave without
it. Are we agreed? <br/>
ARCHER: Agreed. </font></p>

PHLOX: Her needs are modest. A nutrient broth every three or four days.
Less often when she's working. <br/>

PHLOX: She'll ingest a little blood while she's healing an injured
artery. <br/>
E'LIS: Thank you, but I'll just take some vascular adhesive. <br/>
PHLOX: Try this, instead. <br/>(He hands over a gun-like contraption.) <br/>
E'LIS: An auto-suture. <br/>
PHLOX: I'm surprised you don't have one. <br/>
E'LIS: This is a very expensive piece of equipment. I can't. <br/>
PHLOX: Nonsense. Please. Cardio-stimulator, neural shock kit. I had no
idea processing deuterium was such a dangerous business. <br/>
E'LIS: It can be. <br/>
PHLOX: I've only heard of hexatriol being used to treat serious plasma
burns. <br/>
E'LIS: Deuterium can burn almost as hot as plasma when it's ignited. <br/>
PHLOX: I hope you won't need it. Is there something wrong? <br/>
E'LIS: No. I'd better get back. <br/>
PHLOX: Of course. <br/>

T'POL: Not usually. <br/>

TUCKER: How long have these bullies been pushing you around? <br/>
MAKLII: Five seasons. They take all the first yield deuterium we can
extract. <br/>
E'LIS: Hold still. <br/>
MAKLII: After they leave, we manage to pull a few thousand litres out
of the deep strata, but it takes weeks and it's so full of impurities
we can barely refine it. <br/>

TESSIC: You've never seen a Klingon in battle, have you? We tried to
stand up to them once, three seasons ago. Five of us died fighting
them. Then they killed three more to prove their point. <br/>

T'POL: The deuterium's been stowed. Two hundred litres. Should I
instruct Ensign Mayweather to break orbit? <br/>
ARCHER: So that's it? We just take our deuterium and leave? They work
their asses off to provide for their families and then the Klingons
just stroll in and rob them blind. Does that seem right to you? Malcolm
tells me that Klingon ship isn't much more than a freighter. I'd lay
odds they're no match for Enterprise. <br/>
T'POL: And if they withdraw? What will keep them from coming back after
we've gone? <br/>
ARCHER: We could try to contact the Klingon High Council. We saved
Klaang from the Suliban, we pulled one of their battle cruisers out of
a gas giant. I say they owe us a favour. <br/>
T'POL: I doubt these marauders answer to the High Council. <br/>

TESSIC: We've been through this before. It's not your concern. Give it
another turn. <br/>

much longer do you plan on letting this go on? Another five? <br/>
TESSIC: That's good. Leave it there. Reconnect this coolant line.
Intake's above your head. <br/>
ARCHER: I had a talk with my tactical officer. We're confident you have
the ability to defend yourselves. <br/>
TESSIC: We already tried. There are eight people buried not far from
here who can attest to that. <br/>
ARCHER: It would be different this time. We would help you prepare. <br/>
TESSIC: I don't want your help. I'm responsible for my people, not you.
They put their trust in me. They depend on me. I'm supposed to protect
them! Look at me I can barely keep this crawler running. You say you
and your tactical officer want to help us. Even if you do once you're
gone, we'll be alone again waiting for them to come back. <br/>

MAKLII: You must have a well stocked armoury onboard Enterprise. <br/>

surprise can be just as potent as brute force. <br/>
T'POL: Klingons are aggressive warriors but their tactics are crude.
They're slow to adapt to changing circumstances. <br/>
TESSIC: This all sounds very ambitious. What exactly are you expecting
us to do? <br/>
ARCHER: You're going to lure them into a trap. <br/>
TESSIC: What kind of trap? <br/>
TUCKER: A very hot one. The deuterium in those wellheads, how much
pressure is it under? Three, four thousand millibars? <br/>
MAKLII: Five. <br/>
TUCKER: Should create some interesting fireworks. <br/>
TESSIC: You'll never get the Klingons near that deuterium field. They
know it isn't safe. <br/>
MAKLII: They may be crude, but they're not fools. <br/>
ARCHER: That's where deception and surprise come in. Did you bring the
map I asked you for? <br/>
TESSIC: It's right here. <br/>
ARCHER: The structures in the colony, they're mostly modular, right? <br/>
TESSIC: They're all modular. Most deuterium fields are depleted within
three or four years at most. It forces us to be itinerant. <br/>
ARCHER: So you're saying you could relocate these buildings in a
relatively short time. <br/>
MAKLII: It depends where you're suggesting we relocate them. <br/>
ARCHER: About fifty metres to the south, right here. <br/>
TESSIC: What good would that do? The terrain there is no different than
where the town is now. <br/>
TUCKER: That's what we're counting on. If we can move the structures
and the rigs, everything should look pretty much like it did yesterday.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ARCHER: We had a little trouble moving one of the
pumps, but it's in place now. We're ready. <br/>
TESSIC: I just hope everyone survives this. Your people, as well as
mine. <br/>
ARCHER: We left Earth just over a year ago to explore, to meet people
like you. We'd only been out of Spacedock for three days when we found
ourselves in a full-fledged firefight with some pretty nasty characters
called the Suliban. I got shot in the leg. Just before I passed out I
remembered thinking this isn't what I signed up for. I should be
mapping star clusters or making first contact with friendly species.
But when those Suliban started firing at my crew I knew I didn't have
any choice but to fight back. I'm not ashamed to admit I was nervous.
I'm nervous now. But I know we can do this. (comm. chirps) Archer. <br/>
TRAVIS [OC]: The Klingon ship just dropped out of warp, Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: Acknowledged. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Settlement]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The wind blows through the deserted settlement as
the Klingons beam in.) <br/>
KOROK: Listen. <br/>
KLINGON 1: What? <br/>
KOROK: The pumps. They're silent. (raises his voice) Where's your
hospitality? This is no way to treat your friends. Show yourselves! <br/>
(He gives orders in Klingon and his men start to search the
modules. Maklii makes a bird call, and another man shows himself
then runs off.
The Klingons follow and the first one gets knocked down by a wire
suddenly pulled taut. Then the shooting starts and they take cover. The
Starfleet crew have dressed like the colonists, including bandanas to
conceal their lack of forehead markings.) <br/>
KOROK: This will cost you more than deuterium! <br/>
(A woman with excellent aim hits a Klingon with a rock.) <br/>
KLINGON 1: P'taQ! <br/>(he catches up to her and her evasion training keeps
her alive.  Another Klingon enters a module, sees a loose section and thinks he
will catch someone escaping around the back. Archer knocks him out with
a pipe. Tessic also uses the evasion technique, then T'Pol wades in.) <br/>
T'POL: Hey! <br/>(As her feet connect with the Klingon's face, several
times. She knocks him out and they leave the scene.) <br/>T'POL: Come on. <br/>
KLINGON 1: There. <br/>(He aims his weapon at Maklii in amongst the pumps.) <br/>
KOROK: What are you doing? You'll kill us all. Those wellheads, they're
under great pressure. If you ignite them you'll incinerate the entire
town. <br/>(Maklii runs away) <br/>
KLINGON 1: They're making fools of us. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Korok finally uses his binoculars.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
KOROK: They're hiding in the dirt like
Targ. They'll learn to show us respect. We'll kill another four.
Perhaps the boy as well. <br/>
(As the Klingons march towards the gullies where the fighters are
concealed) <br/>
T'POL: Captain. <br/>
ARCHER: They're too far south. <br/>
REED: We've got to get them to move fifty metres to our left. <br/>
ARCHER: Everybody, this way. <br/>
(The Klingons spot them moving, and some throw down their bat'leths to
draw their disruptors.) <br/>
REED: A little farther. This is good. <br/></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Archer watches Korok advance on a pile of stones.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
ARCHER: A few more metres.
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Korok's hobnails connect with metal in the ground, and he finally
takes note of the landscape.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
KOROK: This shouldn't be here. <br/>
ARCHER: Now. <br/>
(Trip sets off his charges and the Klingons are surrounded by a circle
of fire.) <br/>
ARCHER: They're all yours, Tessic. <br/>
TESSIC: Korok! <br/>(The Klingons aim their disruptors at him.)<br/>TESSIC:  I wouldn't
do that. There's two more wellheads by your feet. Leave here now or
we'll ignite them. <br/>
KOROK: P'taQ. You'll live to regret this. <br/>
TESSIC: If you're thinking about coming back, I wouldn't advise it.
We'll be ready. We're not afraid of you anymore. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>(Korok holsters his weapon.) </font><br/><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
KOROK: We can find deuterium anywhere. Yours
isn't fit for a garbage scow. <br/>(He speaks into his communicator and the
party is beamed away. The colonists rejoice at their victory.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Shuttlepod]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TUCKER: Unless you're planning to join Starfleet
I'm afraid you'll have to give up that chair. <br/>
Q'ELL: I wish you didn't have to leave. <br/>
TUCKER: Yeah, that's one of the tough things about my job. Saying
goodbye to people like you and your friends. Oh, almost forgot. <br/>(He gets a
PADD out of a case.) <br/>TUCKER: Schematics for Enterprise. You said you like to
look at starships. This one'll knock your socks off. <br/>
Q'ELL: Thanks. Do you think you'll come back? <br/>
TUCKER: Who knows? Our engines need a lot of deuterium. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Everyone is cleaned up and back in proper desert
uniform.) <br/>
ARCHER: There must be over a thousand litres here. <br/>
MAKLII: Two thousand. <br/>
ARCHER: Our deal was for two hundred. <br/>
TESSIC: Our deal was for power cells, medical supplies and repair work.
You provided us with much more than that. <br/>
MAKLII: Besides, we seem to have a surplus at the moment. <br/>(Q'ell runs
out to join them.) <br/>MAKLII: Give your crew our thanks. <br/>
ARCHER: Have a good season. <br/>
(They get into the shuttlepod and fly off, leaving the deuterium
behind.) </font> </p>
