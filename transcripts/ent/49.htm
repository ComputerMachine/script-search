cybernetic looking corpses are laid out, and a mechanical arm gets put
on a table.) <br/>
DRAKE: I give up. What is it? <br/>
MONINGER: An arm. It's his. <br/>
DRAKE: You're joking. <br/>
MONINGER: From what I can tell, it was integrated into his circulatory
and nervous systems. He could probably operate it like it was his own
flesh and blood. <br/>
DRAKE: I met a Vulcan scientist who wore a prosthesis. He lost his
forearm. It's pretty sophisticated, but it doesn't compare to this. <br/>
MONINGER: Take a look at the eyepiece. Judging by the optics, I'd say
he could see most of the EM spectrum. <br/>
DRAKE: Did you run a genetic analysis? <br/>
MONINGER: That's even more interesting. They don't have much in common.
They belong to two different species. <br/>
DRAKE: Transmit your findings to Starfleet. Maybe they'll find a match
in their database. <br/>
MONINGER: Right away. <br/>
ROONEY: Sir, I've run every test in the book. I still can't identify
this alloy. <br/>
DRAKE: What about this? <br/>
ROONEY: I thought it was simple thermal damage until I found signs of
antimatter residue. <br/>
DRAKE: Maybe their warp drive overloaded. <br/>
ROONEY: That could explain why there's not much debris. I did find some
carbon traces. <br/>
DRAKE: Could you date them? <br/>
ROONEY: This debris has been here for about a hundred years. <br/>
(They are distracted by a drill fitting on the prosthetic arm starting
to whirl, and then stop again. Later -) <br/>
ROONEY: (at microscope) Take a look at this. Do you see those devices?
They're repairing the cell membranes. <br/>
DRAKE: What are they? <br/>
MONINGER: I believe you're looking at a form of nanotechnology. I found
thousands of these in both aliens. They're not just regenerating the
damaged tissue, they're repairing the mechanical components as well. As
far as I can tell, this arm's as good as new. <br/>
DRAKE: The Denobulans have experimented with nanotechnology, but they
have nothing like this. <br/>
MONINGER: Maybe we should move the bodies to Module three, put them
back in cold storage with the other samples. That way, we can examine
them later under controlled conditions. <br/>
DRAKE: Couldn't the bodies be damaged if we freeze them again? <br/>
MONINGER: I guess it's possible. <br/>
DRAKE: Then we should leave them here. Let the regeneration process
continue. <br/>
MONINGER: What if it revives more of their systems? We don't know
anything about this species or what they were doing here a hundred
years ago. <br/>
DRAKE: There's no reason to assume they're hostile. <br/>
MONINGER: They don't exactly look friendly. <br/>
DRAKE: Starfleet has asked us to find out everything we can. Keep them
here for now, we'll see what happens. </font></p>

ROONEY: Cybernetic corpses, digging through frozen remains in the
middle of the night, why would I be jumpy? <br/>
DRAKE: I'd be more worried about the polar bears. <br/>
ROONEY: I've identified twenty two fragments of the outer hull. Each
one has the same curvature. I think this ship was a perfect sphere. <br/>
DRAKE: How big? <br/>
ROONEY: About six hundred metres in diameter. <br/>
DRAKE: The debris field could be a lot more extensive than we thought.
We might want to get another excavation team out here. (her scanner
beeps) What is it? <br/>

ARCHER: The Admiral thinks that they're humanoids enhanced with
technology. He believes they abducted the research team. <br/>
REED: We're a long way from the Arctic. What can we do? <br/>
ARCHER: Earth tracking stations spotted the transport leaving orbit at
warp three point nine. <br/>
TUCKER: That's impossible. Those transports can't exceed one point
four. <br/>
ARCHER: I think it's safe to assume these aliens reconfigured the
engines using technology from their own ship. <br/>
HOSHI: Does Starfleet know where the vessel is now? <br/>
ARCHER: Not exactly, but their heading puts them within a half dozen
light years of our current position. We've been ordered to find the
ship. <br/>
T'POL: It shouldn't be difficult to isolate their warp signature. <br/>

alert. Lay in a course. <br/>

PHLOX: You wanted to see me, Lieutenant? <br/>
REED: Yes. The researchers gathered a great deal of biometric data on
these aliens, but I'm having trouble making heads or tails of it. <br/>
PHLOX: How can I help? <br/>
REED: Well, this arm might contain some sort of weapon. If I can
determine its yield, we'll have a better idea of what we're facing.
<br/>(Phlox operates the computer.) <br/>REED: What sort of people would replace
perfectly good body parts with cybernetic implants? <br/>
PHLOX: You, of all people, should be open-minded about technology. <br/>
REED: I don't have a problem with it, as long as it stays outside of my
skin. <br/>
PHLOX: If your heart was damaged, would you want me to replace it with
a synthetic organ, or would you rather die? <br/>
REED: That's different. <br/>
PHLOX: There's a species I once encountered in the Beta Magellan
system, the Bynars. When they're born, a surgeon removes the child's
parietal lobe and replaces it with a synaptic processor. I saw the
procedure performed once. It was very impressive. <br/>
REED: Yeah, I'm sure it was. Anything? <br/>
PHLOX: I don't see any evidence of a weapon. <br/>

PHLOX: The Tarkaleans should live but the nanoprobes have infiltrated
their autonomic systems. Their renal glands have been replaced with
devices like this. Essentially, these individuals are being transformed
into some sort of cybernetic hybrid. <br/>
ARCHER: You said the human biosigns were erratic. <br/>
T'POL: It's likely the researchers are going through a similar
transformation. <br/>
ARCHER: Can you remove the nanoprobes? <br/>
PHLOX: Not surgically. These devices are multiplying at an
extraordinary rate. I could never extract them all. I'm attempting to
slow their progress with a modified retrovirus, but so far I haven't
been very successful. <br/>
T'POL: Perhaps you should isolate them in the Decon chamber. <br/>
PHLOX: If you do that, I won't be able to treat them as effectively. I
don't believe they're a danger to the crew. <br/>ARCHER: I'm not so sure. I'll have

T'POL: I've contacted Tarkalea. I told them we're doing everything we
can for their crewmen. <br/>
ARCHER: Any sign of the transport? <br/>
T'POL: Nothing. <br/>
ARCHER: There was something familiar about all this, but I couldn't put
my finger on it until I find this speech Zefram Cochrane made eighty
nine years ago. When I was a kid, I read everything I could about him.
It took me a while, but I finally found it in the database. He was
giving a commencement address at Princeton when he started to talk
about what really happened during First Contact. He mentioned a group
of cybernetic creatures from the future who tried to stop his first
warp flight when he was living in Montana. He said they were defeated
by a group of humans who were also from the future. <br/>
T'POL: As I recall, Cochrane was famous for his imaginative stories. He
was also known to be frequently intoxicated. <br/>
ARCHER: No one took him seriously, and he recanted the whole thing a
few years later. But you have to admit, there are similarities. <br/>
T'POL: (reading) He said their ultimate goal was to enslave the human
race. <br/>

ARCHER: Doctor? Phlox. <br/>(Phlox sits up.) <br/>ARCHER: What happened? <br/>
PHLOX: We were attacked. (he grabs a scanner and holds it against his

injected me, some sort of tubules. <br/>

ARCHER: Any progress finding a treatment? <br/>
PHLOX: Possibly. I've been attempting to treat the infection as if it
were, well, an infection. Then it suddenly occurred to me, this isn't a
biological problem. I need to think like an engineer, not a physician.
I extracted several of the devices and subjected them to different
forms of radiation. Their intra-molecular processors appear to be
vulnerable to omicron particles. But if one of the nanoprobes survives,
it will start to multiply again. So I'll need to programme a rather
excessive dose. The side effects will not be pleasant, to say the
least. You may want to keep this in the event I'm unsuccessful. <br/>(He hands
