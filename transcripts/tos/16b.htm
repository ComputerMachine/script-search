Personal log, stardate 3013.1. I find it hard to believe the events of
the past twenty four hours or the plea of Mister Spock
standing general court-martial.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Recap of part one]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MENDEZ: How do you plead to the charge of
unlawfully taking command?<br/>
SPOCK: Guilty.<br/>
MENDEZ: Of sabotaging the computers of this vessel and locking it on a
course for planet Talos Four?<br/>
SPOCK: Guilty.<br/>
MENDEZ: And of forcibly attempting to transport Captain Pike to that
planet?<br/>
SPOCK: Guilty.<br/>
KIRK [OC]: Why? Why does Spock want to take to that forbidden world his
former
captain. Mutilated by a recent space disaster,
now a shell of a man, unable to speak or move? The only answer Spock
would give was on the hearing-room screen.
How Spock could do this he refused to explain, but there before our
eyes, actual images from thirteen years ago of Captain Pike as he was
when he commanded this vessel, of Spock in those days, and of how the
Enterprise had become the first and only starship to visit Talos Four.
They had received a distress signal from that planet and discovered
there, still alive after many years, the survivors of a missing vessel,
only to find it was all an illusion. No survivors, no encampment, it
was all a trap set by a race of beings who could make a man believe he
was seeing anything they wished him to see, and Captain Pike was gone,
a prisoner for some unknown purpose.<br/>
KIRK: And the images we've been seeing are<br/>
SPOCK: Are coming from Talos Four, sir.<br/>
MENDEZ: Mister Spock, you're aware of the orders regarding any contact
with Talos Four. You have deliberately invited the death penalty.<br/>
KIRK: Do you know what you're doing? Have you lost your mind?<br/>
SPOCK: Captain, Jim, please. Don't stop me. Don't let him stop me. It's
your career and Captain Pike's life. You must see the rest of the
transmission.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Hearing room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK [OC]: The court-martial of Mister Spock has
been convened in closed session. Despite all we can do, images continue
to be transmitted to us from Talos Four.<br/>
MENDEZ: Starfleet has ordered no contact with Talos Four. They made no
exceptions.<br/>
SPOCK: You have no choice, sir. I'm sorry. The Keeper has taken over
control of our screen. Do you understand, sir? (flash) As you saw
before, Captain Pike had been knocked unconscious and captured by the
Talosians.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Pike's cage]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Pike discovers there is a transparent wall
blocking his escape, and tests it's strength. A group of aliens arrive)<br/>
PIKE: Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the
space vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this
galaxy. Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me?<br/>
(the aliens communicate with their minds, not voices)<br/>
TALOSIAN: It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen
is shockingly limited.<br/>
MAGISTRATE: This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so
easily with a simulated message. As you can read in its thoughts, it is
only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a
simple illusion we placed in their minds.<br/>
PIKE: You're not speaking, yet I hear you.<br/>
MAGISTRATE: You will note the confusion as it reads our thought
transmissions.<br/>
PIKE: All right, then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read
yours. Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an
unfriendly act<br/>
MAGISTRATE: You now see the primitive fear/threat reaction. The
specimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel,
and so on. Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess,
the creature will throw himself against the transparency.<br/>
PIKE: If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these
walls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it.<br/>
MAGISTRATE: Despite its frustration, the creature appears more
adaptable than our specimens from other planets. We can soon begin the
experiment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Briefing room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: The inhabitants of this planet must live
deep underground, probably manufacture food and other needs down there.
Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more
vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.<br/>
NUMBER ONE: So we just thought we saw survivors there.<br/>
SPOCK: Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's
inhabitants.<br/>
BOYCE: It was a perfect illusion. They had us seeing just what we
wanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery,
everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp,
the tattered clothing, everything. Now let's be sure we understand the
danger of this. The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds, they
can create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and
experiences, even out of a person's own desires. Illusions just as real
and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore.<br/>
TYLER: It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help.<br/>
SPOCK: If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their
mental power's so great they could reach out and swat this ship as
though it were a fly.<br/>
TYLER: Now that entry may have stood up against hand lasers but we can
transmit the ship's power against it, enough to blast half a continent.<br/>
NUMBER ONE: Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power. We'll
try blasting through that metal.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TALOSIAN: Thousands of us are already probing the
creature's thoughts, Magistrate. We find excellent memory capacity.<br/>
MAGISTRATE: I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it
fought to protect its life. We will begin with this, giving the
specimen something more interesting to protect.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Rigel 7]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VINA: Come on, we must hide ourselves. Come, come,
hurry. It's deserted. There'll be weapons and perhaps food.<br/>
PIKE: This is Rigel Seven.<br/>
VINA: Please, we must hide ourselves.<br/>
PIKE: I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo. I must still be
there.<br/>
VINA: Come on.<br/>
PIKE: They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere
I've been.<br/>
VINA: The Kaylar!<br/>
PIKE: It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago, except for you.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Hearing room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: A brilliant deduction by Captain Pike,
gentlemen. Yes, he was still inside his cell, but knowing that couldn't
help him.<br/>
KIRK: The Talosians controlled his brain.<br/>
SPOCK: And could make him live any place, any time, any situation they
wished. He would see, taste, suffer with the same reality as you
gentlemen sitting there.<br/>
PIKE [on screen]: Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one
the survivors call Vina. Or rather the image of Vina. But why you
again? Why didn't they create a different girl?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VINA: Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.<br/>
PIKE: But it's only a dream.<br/>
VINA: You have to kill him as you did here before.<br/>
PIKE: You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an
animal performing for its supper.<br/>
VINA: It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it. That's what
matters. You'll feel every moment of what happens to you.<br/>

he can grab. He is pushed off a ledge, and as it jumps off after him,
he impales it on a barbed spearhead)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MENDEZ: What is it? Why have they stopped the
images?<br/>
SPOCK: Because they know that Captain Pike is fatigued. We can
reconvene later.<br/>
KIRK: Then they care about the Captain.<br/>
SPOCK: They want him back alive, sir.<br/>
MENDEZ: I demand to know why.<br/>
SPOCK: If you'll be patient, the answers to your questions<br/>
MENDEZ: You're forgetting you're on trial, Spock. You will answer all
questions put to you.<br/>
SPOCK: My answer to your question would be quite unbelievable, sir. I
regret we'll have to wait and see it there.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PIKE: No, no. No, that's not an answer. I've never
met you before, never even imagined you.<br/>
VINA: Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.<br/>
PIKE: What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear?<br/>
VINA: I can wear whatever you wish, be anything you wish.<br/>
PIKE: So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how
I react, is that it?<br/>
VINA: Don't you have a, a dream, something you've always wanted very
badly?<br/>
PIKE: Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too?<br/>
VINA: You can have whatever dream you want. I can become anything, any
woman you, you've ever imagined. You can have anything you want in the
whole universe. Let me please you.<br/>
PIKE: Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there
any way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts
against me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way?<br/>
VINA: You're a fool.<br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VINA: Perhaps if you asked me some questions I
could answer.<br/>
PIKE: How far can they control my mind?<br/>
VINA: If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let
me live it with you?<br/>
PIKE: Perhaps.<br/>
VINA: They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do.<br/>
PIKE: But they try to trick me with their illusions.<br/>
VINA: And, er, they can punish you when you're not co-operative. You'll
find out about that. <br/>
PIKE: Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go
underground?<br/>
VINA: War, thousands of centuries ago.<br/>
PIKE: That's why it's so barren up there?<br/>
VINA; The planet's only now becoming able to support life again.<br/>
PIKE: So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and
they concentrated on developing their mental power.<br/>
VINA: But they found it's a trap, like a narcotic, because when dreams
become more important than reality, you give up travel, building,
creating. You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by
your ancestors. You just sit, living and reliving other lives left
behind in the thought record.<br/>
PIKE: Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.<br/>
VINA: You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion
for you, they watch you react, feel your emotions. They have a whole
collection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from
all over this part of the galaxy.<br/>
PIKE: Which means they had to have more than one of each animal.<br/>
VINA: Please.<br/>
PIKE: They'll need a pair of humans too. Where do they get intend to
get the Earth woman?<br/>
VINA: You said that if I answered questions<br/>
PIKE: But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist. You said
you weren't real, remember?<br/>
VINA: I'm a woman as real and as human as you are. We are like Adam and
Eve. If we. No, please, no! Don't punish me! I'll die! (disappears)<br/>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(as Pike searches the walls for a door, a hatch
opens and a glass is placed on the floor)<br/>
KEEPER: The vial contains a nourishing protein complex.<br/>
PIKE: Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?<br/>
KEEPER: If the form and the colour is not appealing, it can appear as
any food you wish to visualise.<br/>
PIKE: And if I prefer<br/>
KEEPER: To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of
punishment.<br/>
(Pike is surrounded by fire and brimstone, screaming in pain)<br/>
KEEPER: From a fable you once heard in childhood. You will now consume
the nourishment.<br/>
PIKE: Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you
can't, can you? You do have limitations, don't you?<br/>
KEEPER: If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there are
things even more unpleasant.<br/>
(he drinks the nourishment then launches himself at the glass wall. The
Keeper steps back in surprise)<br/>
PIKE: That's very interesting.<br/>
KEEPER: Now to the female.<br/>
PIKE: You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then?<br/>
KEEPER: As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our planet,
but with only a single survivor.<br/>
PIKE: No, let's stay on the first subject. All I wanted for that moment
was to get my hands around your neck.<br/>
KEEPER: We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species
interesting.<br/>
PIKE: Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through?<br/>
KEEPER: It became necessary to attract a mate.<br/>
PIKE: All right, all right. Let's talk about the girl. You seem to be
going out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel
protective.<br/>
KEEPER; This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species.<br/>
PIKE: Seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and
like her.<br/>
KEEPER: We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life.<br/>
PIKE: Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her? So
I'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship? That would be necessary
only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human
community.<br/>
KEEPER: With the female now properly conditioned.<br/>
PIKE: You mean properly punished! I'm the one who's not cooperating!
Why don't you punish me?<br/>
KEEPER: First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy.
Excellent.

thermos hooked to my saddle.<br/>

Well, they think of everything, don't they? (feeds lumps to the horse) <br/>
VINA: Is it good to be home?<br/>
PIKE: They read our minds very well. Home, anything else I want if I
co-operate, is that it?<br/>
VINA: My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it? You're home. You
can even stay if you want.<br/>
PIKE: But we're not here, neither of us. We're in a menagerie, a cage!<br/>
VINA: No.<br/>
PIKE; I can't help either one of us if you won't give me a chance. Now,
you told me once they used illusions as a narcotic. They couldn't
repair the machines left by their ancestors. Is that why they want us,
to build a colony of slaves?<br/>
VINA: Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us?<br/>
PIKE: Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our
keeper couldn't read my thoughts. Do emotions like hate, keeping hate
in your mind, does that block off our mind from them?<br/>
VINA: Yes. They can't read through primitive emotions, but you can't
keep it up for long enough. I've tried. They keep at you and at you
year after year, tricking and punishing, and they won. They own me. I
know you must hate me for that.<br/>
PIKE: Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like.<br/>
VINA: But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my
feelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man. That's why they
picked you. I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the
same way.<br/>
PIKE: If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you. I
was from the very first moment I saw you in the survivor's camp. You
were like a wild little animal. <br/>
VINA; I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for you. You've
been home, and fighting as on Rigel. That's not new to you, either. A
person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do. Yes, a ship's
captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and
proper. You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that.

VINA: He's not bluffing, Captain. With illusion they can make your crew
work the wrong controls or push any button it takes to destroy your
ship.<br/>
PIKE: I'm going to gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason
at all. (hands him over to Number One and picks up the laser pistols,
firing them at the glass wall) On the other hand, I've got a reason.
I'm willing to bet you've created an illusion this laser is empty. I
think it just blasted a hole in that window and you're keep us from
seeing it. You want me to test my theory out on your head?<br/>
COLT: Captain. (there is a hole in the glass, and they all leave
through it)

SPOCK: Gentlemen, a moment, please.<br/>
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock?<br/>
MENDEZ: (to Pike) May I have your verdict?<br/>
SPOCK: Signal you want them to wait. Captain, please. It's your life
now, at least a chance for life.<br/>
KIRK: You keep talking about life, Mister Spock. A chance for life.
How? As a prisoner, caged, a zoo specimen, living the illusions that
amuse his keepers?<br/>
SPOCK: No, Captain. there's more to it. Watch. (the screen remains
blank)<br/>
MENDEZ: Guilty, yes or no, Captain? (flash) Yes. I must also vote
guilty as charged. And you, Captain?<br/>
KIRK: Guilty as charged.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PIKE: Make contact, Number One.<br/>
NUMBER ONE: They kept us from seeing this, too. We cut through and
never knew it. Captain.<br/>
KEEPER: As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing.<br/>
PIKE: I want to contact our ship.<br/>
KEEPER: You are now on the surface where we wished you to be. With the
female of your choice, you will now begin carefully guided lives.<br/>
PIKE: And start by burying you?<br/>
KEEPER: That is your choice. To help you reclaim the planet's surface,
our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life.<br/>
PIKE: Look, I'll make a deal with you. You and your life for the lives
of these two Earth women. You give me proof that our ship is all right,
send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina.<br/>
NUMBER ONE: (setting laser pistol to overload) It's wrong to create a
whole race of humans to live as slaves.<br/>
KEEPER: Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves?<br/>
VINA: What is that?<br/>
PIKE: The weapon is building up an overload, a force chamber explosion.
You still have time to get underground. Well, go on! (pushes Vina away)
Just to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her.<br/>
VINA: If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go,
either. I suppose if they have one human being, they might try again.
(more Talosians arrive) <br/>
PIKE: Wait.<br/>
TALOSIAN: Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much
time. Are you prepared to assimilate it?<br/>
KEEPER: We had not believed this possible. The customs and history of
your race show a unique hatred of captivity. Even when it's pleasant
and benevolent, you prefer death. This makes you too violent and
dangerous a species for our needs.<br/>
VINA: He means that they can't use you. You're free to go back to the
ship.<br/>
PIKE: And that's it. No apologies. You captured one of us, threatened
all of us.<br/>
TALOSIAN: Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to
eventual death. Is this not sufficient?<br/>
KEEPER: No other specimen has shown your adaptability. You were our
last hope.<br/>
PIKE: But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual cooperation.<br/>
KEEPER: Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy itself,
too.<br/>
NUMBER ONE: Captain, we have transporter control now.<br/>
PIKE: Let's get back to the ship.<br/>

rebuilt me. Everything works, but they had never seen a human. They had
no guide for putting me back together.<br/>

honest one.<br/>

SPOCK [OC]: All decks prepare for hyperdrive.<br/>
NUMBER ONE [OC]: All decks are ready, sir.<br/>
PIKE [on screen]: Engage.<br/>
KIRK: Commodore, don't you think that (Mendez disappears)<br/>
KEEPER [on screen]: What you now seem to hear, Captain Kirk, are my
thought transmissions. The Commodore was never aboard your vessel. His
presence there and in the shuttlecraft was an illusion. Mister Spock
had related to us your strength of will. It was thought the fiction of
a court-martial would divert you from too soon regaining control of
your vessel. Captain Pike is welcome to spend the rest of his life with
us, unfettered by his physical body. The decision is yours and his.<br/>
KIRK: Mister Spock, even if regulations are explicit, you could have
come to me and explained.<br/>
SPOCK: Ask you to face the death penalty, too? One of us was enough,
Captain.<br/>
KIRK: Yes.<br/>
UHURA [OC]: Message from Starbase Eleven, sir. Received images from
Talos Four. In view of historic importance of Captain Pike in space
exploration, General Order Seven prohibiting contact Talos Four is
suspended this occasion. No action contemplated against Spock. Proceed
as you think best. Signed, Mendez, J.I., Commodore, Starbase Eleven. <br/>
KIRK: Chris, do you want to go there? (flash) Mister Spock, would you
care to take Captain Pike to the transporter room, see him off?<br/>
SPOCK: Thank you, sir, for both of us. (flash)<br/>
KIRK: Er, Mister Spock, when you're finished, please come back and see
me. I want to talk to you. This regret table tendency you've been
showing lately towards flagrant emotionalism<br/>
SPOCK: I see no reason to insult me, sir. I believe I've been
completely logical about the whole affair.<br/>
KEEPER [OC] Captain Kirk.<br/>
(screen shows the healthy young Vina and healthy young Pike hand in
hand)<br/>
KEEPER [on screen]: Captain Pike has an illusion, and you have reality.
May you find your way as pleasant. </font> </p>
