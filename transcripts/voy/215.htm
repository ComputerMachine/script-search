is in the Mess hall, in his chef's outfit.) <br/>
NEELIX: Good day, Voyager and welcome to A Briefing With Neelix. It's a
catchy title, isn't it? I'll be coming to you each and every day with
news of general interest. Interviews with our fascinating crew members.
Musical performances. Recommendations for new holodeck programmes. And
of course, previews of upcoming meals. Everything from Hlaka soup to
Zabee nuts. A Briefing With Neelix will help you stay informed about
ship's activities, er, keep you abreast of your colleague's
accomplishments and broaden your knowledge about a wealth of subjects.
But most of all, it will make you feel good, because what you see here
will always be the most uplifting, optimistic view of everything that
happens on our ship. After all, as your morale officer, isn't it my job
to bring a little joy into everyone's day? Hmm? Captain Janeway has
agreed to appear on the show with regular updates about the ship's
progress, and Commander Chakotay will commend outstanding crew members.
So snap to and keep those boots polished to a shine. You never know
when you might be featured on A Briefing With Neelix. Ready, Ensign? <br/>
BAYTART [OC]: All set, Neelix. <br/>
NEELIX: In just a moment, an amazing talent. Ensign Pablo Baytart will
astound you with his juggling ability. He'll keep
PADDs, hyposprays, even phasers in the air for minutes at a time. But
before that, what makes people feel better than a little romance? And
what Lieutenant in a gold uniform was recently huddled in the Mess Hall
with what crewman in blue having a very intimate conversation over a
carafe of Silmic wine? Well, I'd never name names, but you know who you
are. Best wishes to a handsome pair of lovebirds. And now, ladies and
gentlemen, Ensign Pablo Baytart. </font></p>

(The EMH turns off the monitor before Baytart's juggling act appears.) <br/>
EMH: I'm a doctor, not a performer. I don't have time for such
nonsense. <br/>
NEELIX: I can see Hints for Healthful Living becoming a very popular
segment, Doctor. <br/>
EMH: I don't think so. <br/>
NEELIX: You'd be lifted to a whole new level in the crew's eyes. They'd
hang on your every word. You'd enjoy a, a popularity, a, a celebrity
that you've never known before. <br/>

KIM: Deck four. Recipes, music, jugglers. It's sort of like a steady
diet of dessert, which is fine, but pretty soon you want some meat and
potatoes. <br/>
NEELIX: You do? <br/>
KIM: When I was in school, I was editor of the Academy newspaper for a
year. I monitored subspace transmissions. I got reports on some of the
first activity by the Maquis against the Cardassians. I wrote an
editorial about it, and the students became polarised on the issue.
They debated the pros and cons, and gained an insight into the entire
history of the political rebellion. Now, that's the power of
journalism. <br/>
NEELIX: What did your professors say when you told them you were going
to publish the editorial? <br/>
KIM: I didn't tell them. It's the job of a journalist to be
independent. <br/>
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Bridge to Mister Neelix. You have an incoming

I never want to see another wheel of Pendrashian cheese. <br/>
LAXETH [on monitor]: Those days are behind me. I'm legitimate now. I'm
communications master of a Talaxian convoy. <br/>
NEELIX: Communications master? Well, you've certainly come up in the
world. Congratulations. <br/>
LAXETH [on monitor]: Looks like I'll be seeing you in a few days. <br/>
NEELIX: How's that? <br/>
LAXETH [on monitor]: We've been asked to rendezvous with your ship.
We're going to pick up a passenger. <br/>
NEELIX: Passenger? We don't carry any passengers. <br/>
LAXETH [on monitor]: Apparently, it's a member of your crew. All I know
is someone wants to leave your ship and come to work for us.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Just how, exactly, did you hear that someone was leaving the ship? <br/>
NEELIX: An old friend of mine is serving with a Talaxian convoy. He
told me they'd be rendezvousing with us in a few days. <br/>
JANEWAY: Janeway to Tuvok. <br/>
TUVOK [OC]: Yes, Captain? <br/>
JANEWAY: Could you join us in my Ready room, please? <br/>
TUVOK [OC]: Right away. <br/>
(Tuvok enters.) <br/>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant, Mister Neelix has heard on good authority that one
of our crew will be leaving the ship in a few days. Naturally, he's
curious about the identity of this person. What are the security issues
here? <br/>
TUVOK: I don't believe there are any serious concerns, Captain. There
is no need to withhold this information any longer. <br/>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant Paris has asked to be put off the ship. <br/>
NEELIX: Tom? <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm sure you're aware that he's had some problems lately. <br/>
NEELIX: Well, yes. <br/>
TUVOK: He has been disruptive, and often sets a bad example for the
rest of the crew. <br/>
NEELIX: But he seemed so determined to get those things behind him. It
means a lot to him to be respected by this crew. <br/>
JANEWAY: All I can tell you is that when he was relieved of duty, he
asked me to make arrangements for him to leave the ship. I tried to
talk him out of it, but he was adamant. We detected the Talaxian
convoy, and they were more than happy to get a pilot of Tom's ability. <br/>
NEELIX: I can't believe this. I never thought. Captain, may I speak
with him? <br/>
JANEWAY: Of course. He's in his quarters.

PARIS: Come in. <br/>
NEELIX: Hello, Tom. <br/>
PARIS: Neelix! How's it going? Not good, it looks like. What's wrong? <br/>
NEELIX: I hear you're leaving the ship? <br/>
PARIS: Good news travels fast, I guess. Yeah, I figured there was quite
a bit more opportunity for advancement on a Talaxian convoy than there
was on the only Starfleet ship in the quadrant. <br/>
NEELIX: When did you make this decision? <br/>
PARIS: Truthfully? About a minute and a half after I set foot on this
ship a year ago. I knew it was a mistake to try to fit into Starfleet
again, and I should have listened to myself. A few more months in that
rehab colony would have been a hell of a lot better than being here. <br/>
NEELIX: Tom, you and I have had our differences, but I thought we put
those behind us. I just hope I haven't contributed to your decision? <br/>
PARIS: Neelix, no. This isn't about anybody except me. I've done this
to myself, just like always. No matter where I go or who I'm with, I
make a mess of things. The unmistakable conclusion has to be that deep
down, I don't want any friends, or a family, or a home. Otherwise, I
wouldn't keep sabotaging the possibilities. <br/>
NEELIX: I thought you found those things here. <br/>
PARIS: I tried. Or maybe I just told myself I was trying. I'm not sure.
Either way, it's just not working. Frankly, I'd like to get out before
I completely destroy my image. There might actually be one or two
people who still have a good opinion of me. <br/>
NEELIX: I'm one of them, Tom. And I wish you wouldn't go. <br/>
PARIS: Well, I thank you. But the truth is, I've always considered
myself a drifter. You know what that's like, Neelix. Freedom to do what
you want, when you want. No rules to follow, nobody depending on you,
right? <br/>

EMH [on monitor]: I want to discuss the details of my participation on
your programme. I've been giving it a great deal of thought, and I've
come up with a number of ideas I think you'll find quite intriguing. <br/>
NEELIX: Well, that's good news, I-I'm delighted you've decided to
become a contributor. But I'm afraid I don't have time to discuss it
right now. <br/>
EMH [on monitor]: But I've already prepared today's topic. How to keep
your nostrils happy. <br/>
NEELIX: That is fascinating, but I'm afraid there's a more important
story I have to work on today. <br/>
EMH [on monitor]: You mean I'm not going to appear today? <br/>
NEELIX: When you see it, I'm sure you will understand. <br/>
EMH [on monitor]: Hmm. But I will be on tomorrow? <br/>
NEELIX: Definitely. Without fail. I promise you. <br/>
EMH [on monitor]: Very well. But tomorrow I'll want to cover two

NEELIX: Good morning, Voyager. I want to tell you about a friend of
mine. I first met this man almost a year ago, and tell you the truth, I
didn't like him much. He seemed a little too cocky, a little too sure
of himself. A lot of people had questions about him. He'd proven he'd
pretty much sell himself out to the highest bidder, go wherever the
wind blew him, so people wondered, could you trust this person when
things got tough? Would he stand side by side with you, or would he let
you down when you needed him most?
But the fact of the matter is, he proved himself right from the
beginning. I wouldn't be alive right now if it weren't for him. And the
same goes for many of you. It took me a while to realize it. Like a lot
of people, I was too caught up in first impressions to see the truth
that was right in front of me. I overlooked his bravery because I was
focusing of his brashness. I ignored his courage because I saw it as
arrogance. And I resented his friendliness because I mistook it for
licentiousness. So while this man was giving us his best every minute
of every day, I was busy judging him. And now he's leaving. I'm proud
to say that in spite of my narrow-mindedness, Thomas Eugene Paris
became my friend. I'm going to miss him. No more laughs over a game of
pool. No more sitting up into the wee hours swapping stories. No more
complaints about my cooking. Goodbye, Tom. I think I speak for more of
us than you might imagine when I say you're going to leave an empty
space when you go. I hope you find what you're looking for. <br/>

Lieutenant, Operations has detected a minute increase in the engine
core temperature. Are you aware of it? <br/>
TORRES: Yes, Captain. There's a slight imbalance in the magnetic
constrictors. It's causing the plasma stream to overheat. I have a team
working on it. <br/>
JANEWAY: Keep me posted. Mister Neelix, I'm very pleased with your
programme, especially your tribute to Lieutenant Paris. <br/>
NEELIX: Thank you. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, have you decided who's going to replace Paris? <br/>
JANEWAY: I have several people in mind. Baytart is one. Hamilton. <br/>
KIM: Captain, do you think? I mean, it's possible Tom might change his
mind to come back. Maybe you shouldn't replace him so quickly. <br/>
JANEWAY: Harry, Lieutenant Paris made his decision with no indication
that he had any doubts about it, or that he might change his mind in
the near future. We have to accept that and move on. What's our

TORRES: Have you tried adjusting the power transfer conduits? <br/>
JONAS: Yes. No effect. <br/>
TORRES: We have to try to contain the reaction in the core. Don't let
the PTC temperature get above three point two million
Kelvins. <br/>
JONAS: It's at two point nine million now. <br/>
JONAS: PTC temperature now at three million Kelvins. We're going to
have to vent some plasma. <br/>
TORRES: If you vent some plasma that hot through the nacelles, the warp
coils are going to fry. <br/>
JONAS: Better that than a core breach! <br/>
TORRES: Reinforce the structural field around the power transfer
conduits, and then prepare to begin venting plasma! <br/>
JONAS: PTC temperature now three point two million Kelvins. <br/>

condition of each of the victims, and then to prioritise treatment
accordingly. <br/>

the crew. <br/>

The plasma burst irradiated the engine nacelles. The inner layer of the
warp coils was burned away. <br/>
TORRES: Which means the warp engines are useless until we can rebuild
them. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: They're made from a substance known as verterium cortenide.
Do you know where we can find a source? <br/>
NEELIX: Verterium cortenide, if I'm not mistaken, that's a densified
composite material. <br/>
TORRES: That's right. It's composed of polysilicate verterium and
monocrystal cortenum. <br/>
JANEWAY: Do you know any nearby source? <br/>
NEELIX: Let's see. Er, there's a yellow dwarf system called Hemikek
with an M-class planet quite rich in minerals. Mining rights belong to
a consortium of non-aggressive people. I'm sure we could make
arrangements to purchase some verterium and cortenum. <br/>

nothing I can change. But I can promise you'll be well-treated on this

quite valuable. <br/>

information about Voyager from somewhere. <br/>

Something just doesn't make sense. I mean, he wasn't off the ship for a
day when the Kazon attacked that convoy. How did they find out so fast
that Tom was there? <br/>
KES: Maybe someone on the convoy told them. <br/>
NEELIX: A Talaxian convoy would never let the Kazon know where they
are. That would be like committing suicide. <br/>
KES: Maybe they came to rob the cargo, but when they realised there was
a Starfleet officer <br/>
NEELIX: That wouldn't have stopped them from taking the cargo too. And
according to my friend Laxeth, it was a swift, efficient strike. It
sounds like they knew Tom was there, and they came just to get him. <br/>

anomalous. <br/>
JONAS: Why? <br/>
NEELIX: An incident I'm investigating. Tell me, Mister Hero. If someone
wanted to make a secret subspace transmission, how would he do it? <br/>
JONAS: Why would you want to know that? <br/>
NEELIX: Oh, I can't be too forthcoming right now, but if I find what I
think I'm going to, well, let me just say that this ship will be
stunned. <br/>
JONAS: A secret transmission, huh? Well, that would be tough, Neelix.
There are all kinds of security routines in place and anytime a
subspace antenna array is in use, the sensors make a record of it. I'm
not seeing anything anomalous here. <br/>
NEELIX: What about that? <br/>
JONAS: What? <br/>
NEELIX: That gap, as if some of the log entries have been deleted. <br/>
JONAS: Well, that's just a data fragmentation. <br/>
NEELIX: I beg your pardon? <br/>
JONAS: Well, it probably happened when the plasma overloaded the
system. Little glitches like this'll be popping up for weeks, I'd
imagine. <br/>
NEELIX: Here it is again. <br/>
JONAS: I wouldn't worry about it. <br/>
NEELIX: Maybe Lieutenant Torres can explain it. <br/>
JONAS: There's nothing to explain. Believe me, Neelix. You're making
too much of it. <br/>
(Jonas fires up a micro-welder.) <br/>
NEELIX: Ah. Here it is again. Gaps in the log entries. And frankly it
looks like more than data fragmentation to me. The gaps are showing up
in logs entered over the last months, but not before that. <br/>
(Jonas creeps up behind Neelix.) <br/>
EMH [on monitor]: So, there you are. I've been looking for you, Mister
Neelix. <br/>
NEELIX: Doctor! How can I help you? <br/>
EMH [on monitor]: You again neglected to include me in your news
programme. If you remember, I was to have two segments today because I
was excluded yesterday. <br/>
NEELIX: That's right, that's right. I've been so preoccupied with this
other matter. <br/>
EMH [on monitor]: In the interest of time, I'm willing to forgo my
story on the adrenal gland. I will concentrate instead on my latest
idea. The Klingon glottis, friend or foe? <br/>
NEELIX: That's very interesting, but we're going to have to put it off
until tomorrow. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
All through the subspace communication logs, there were these gaps, as
though something had been erased. <br/>
TUVOK: We have recently experienced a plasma overload. That could
easily account for the anomalous readings in the logs. <br/>
NEELIX: Ah ha! I knew you'd say that. Answer this, Mister Vulcan. Why
would those gaps, those deletions, occur only in the sub-com logs and
only in the last month? I checked every log system we have. Sensor
logs, power allocation logs, warp maintenance logs, environmental
control logs. They're all perfectly fine. <br/>
TUVOK: What are you suggesting? <br/>
NEELIX: I believe someone on this ship has been making covert
transmissions and erasing the evidence. <br/>
TUVOK: To what end? <br/>
NEELIX: I don't know, but I suspect whoever it was has been
communicating with the Kazon. <br/>
TUVOK: That's an extremely serious charge. <br/>
NEELIX: I know. That's why I've come to you. <br/>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, I strongly suspect that your enthusiasm for your
new journalistic endeavour is leading you to see villains where none
exist. However, even the possibility that someone on board might
secretly be communicating with the Kazon deserves investigation. I will
pursue the matter. <br/>
NEELIX: And I will help you. <br/>
TUVOK: I think not. This is now a matter of ship security. I must ask
you to withdraw and let me handle it according to Starfleet protocols. <br/>
NEELIX: As a journalist, I have an ethical obligation to keep digging
for the facts in this case. <br/>
TUVOK: And I have the higher obligation to keep you from putting
yourself and others at risk. You will drop this matter. <br/>

TORRES: I'm a little busy right now, Neelix. What do you need? <br/>
NEELIX: I was wondering if it's possible to look underneath a log that
seems to have been erased, to see if there's anything left of it. <br/>
TORRES: Mister Hogan, could you please help Neelix out for a minute? <br/>
HOGAN: You want to recover deleted logs? <br/>
NEELIX: Ah, that would be ideal. <br/>
HOGAN: Well, let me give it a try. Usually it's possible to recover
data, unless extraordinary measures were taken to erase it. Now, this
is strange. Computer, run a signal modulation analysis of this file. <br/>
COMPUTER: Security authorisation required. <br/>
HOGAN: Engineering authorisation omega four seven. <br/>
COMPUTER: Authorisation accepted. Running analysis. <br/>
NEELIX: What? <br/>
HOGAN: I can't recover the logs, because these messages were sent
without using any of the antenna arrays. <br/>
NEELIX: How could someone do that? <br/>
HOGAN: By sending the transmissions through the ship's power grid. The
messages were encoded in the waste energy from the propulsion systems,
which is almost indistinguishable from galactic background noise. <br/>
NEELIX: Ingenious. Would there be a way to determine who sent the
messages? <br/>
HOGAN: I'm looking for signal correlation traces. They'd indicate a
comm. link to the EPS conduits, maybe give us a location. I don't know
if I can. There. There's one. The source of the comm. link is on deck
four, section three C. Sorry, but I can't get more specific than that. <br/>
JONAS: Mister Hogan, I need your help over here. <br/>
NEELIX: Thanks for your help. I'll check out deck four. Go room by
room, console by console. <br/>

[on monitor]: My friends, I derive no satisfaction from what I am about
to tell you. I know I originally promised you that I would only bring
you good news. However, I feel it's important that you know the truth.
I have uncovered evidence that casts serious doubt on the loyalties of
Lieutenant Thomas Paris. I have discovered secret communications to the
Kazon that were sent from his quarters just prior to his leaving the
ship. <br/>
JANEWAY: Get him up here now. <br/>
NEELIX [on monitor]: There was a series of messages sent to the Kazon
for some weeks before his departure, the last <br/>
(Tuvok obeys. A short time later - ) <br/>
JANEWAY: How did you trace those transmissions to Tom's quarters? <br/>
NEELIX: It was, er, I believe it was called signal correlation traces.
Mister Hogan was helping me, and he detected them. <br/>
TUVOK: When I looked for signal correlation traces, there were none.
That means someone placed them in the system after my initial
investigation. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: What initial investigation? Captain, what's going on? <br/>
JANEWAY: What I'm about to say will come as a surprise to you,
Commander. There has been a spy aboard Voyager, but it isn't Tom Paris.
<br/>
NEELIX: It isn't? <br/>
PARIS: No. Lieutenant Paris is in fact part of our plan. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Plan. <br/>
JANEWAY: Some weeks ago, Tuvok discovered evidence of covert
transmissions leaving Voyager through the EPS system. We realised there
was someone on this ship communicating with the Kazon-Nistrim. <br/>
TUVOK: However, we were unable to ascertain who that person was. <br/>
JANEWAY: We needed a way to flush out the spy, and we had exhausted all
conventional means. That's when we thought of using Tom, finding a way
to get him on the Kazon ship. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Are you saying Paris's insulting behaviour, the gambling,
being late for duty, mouthing off at me, was all a ruse? <br/>
TUVOK: That is correct. It was important that his decision to leave the
ship appear plausible, so he began behaving like a malcontent. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: And the reason I wasn't let in on this little plan? <br/>
TUVOK: I was the one who recommended to Captain Janeway that you not be
told. I suspected that the spy was a Maquis, and felt it was wrong to
put you in a position of setting a trap for someone who had once served
under you. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: In other words, you didn't trust me. <br/>
JANEWAY: Commander, the simple fact is, we needed a good performance.
I'm afraid we used you to help Tom provide it. And you did a damn good
job. Now it seems Mister Neelix's investigation has made someone
nervous. Nervous enough to put a trail in the computer system for him
to follow. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Could it be Hogan? <br/>
NEELIX: I don't think so. He was just the person walking by who
Lieutenant Torres asked to help me. <br/>
JANEWAY: The spy may be a little cosy now, since you took the bait and
pointed the finger at Tom. But we don't want him cosy. I'd rather he
feel some pressure. <br/>
TUVOK: Perhaps we should take advantage of Mister Neelix's
unintentional blunder. <br/>
JANEWAY: Exactly. I want you to keep investigating, Neelix. Do what
you've been doing. Poke around, ask questions. But let people think
you're not so sure you were right about Tom Paris. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: That would put Neelix in a potentially dangerous situation. <br/>
TUVOK: We would keep an open comm. link to you at all hours. My
security team could act immediately if anything were to happen. <br/>
JANEWAY: It's up to you, Neelix. This is purely voluntary. <br/>
NEELIX: Anything I can do to help, Captain, and get Tom home safely, I
want to do. </font></p>
