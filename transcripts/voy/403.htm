Commander Chakotay. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: I understand you wanted to see me. <br/>
SEVEN: I'm told you are the officer in charge of personnel. That you
prepare the duty assignments. Is that the correct phrase? <br/>
CHAKOTAY: That's right. <br/>
SEVEN: I am finding it difficult to spend so much time alone. I am
unaccustomed to it. The hours do not pass quickly. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: I can understand that. How can we help? <br/>
SEVEN: I've been considering the matter carefully. I would like to
request a duty assignment. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Did you have something specific in mind? <br/>
SEVEN: Yes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Now what!?<br/>
VORIK: There's been a rupture in the coolant injector. <br/>
TORRES: I can see that. Why haven't you sealed it off? <br/>
VORIK: I am attempting to do so. <br/>(The leak stops.)<br/>
TORRES: That's better. <br/>
VORIK: Lieutenant, I have an idea. Perhaps it would be advisable to
reconfigure the coolant assembly. That would give us greater control
over the pressure valve emissions. <br/>
TORRES: You're probably right. And tomorrow we can do it first thing.
But not today. <br/>
VORIK: I don't understand. Why wait until tomorrow? Today would be a
much better <br/>
TORRES: Not today, Vorik. <br/>
PARIS: Good morning. Here's the helm control evaluation you wanted. <br/>
TORRES: Thank you. <br/>
PARIS: Are we still on for dinner tonight? <br/>
TORRES: I may have to work. I'll let you know. <br/>
PARIS: Ah ha. Okay. Have you decided if you're, if you're going through
with it? <br/>
TORRES: I have. And I'm not. Today hasn't started out very well, and
the last thing I need is to get involved with some obscure Klingon
ritual. <br/>
PARIS: You were the one who suggested it. <br/>
TORRES: I know. And for one sentimental minute I thought that I might
actually go through with it. But not anymore. <br/>
PARIS: Of course not. You wouldn't want to get too sentimental. <br/>
TORRES: I overslept this morning because I forgot to tell the computer
to wake me. And then the acoustic inverter in my sonic shower blew out.
<br/>
PARIS: That'll make your hair stand on end. <br/>
TORRES: So I didn't have time for breakfast. And when I got here two
people were out sick, so I had to cancel the fuel cell overhaul. And
then an injector burst for no apparent reason and started spewing
plasma coolant <br/>
PARIS: That's a run of bad luck, all right. <br/>
TORRES: So I am in a bad mood, and I know that I am being a little bit
testy. <br/>
PARIS: No, that's okay. Think about that dinner.<br/>(Chakotay enters. Paris whispers to him on his way out.)<br/>PARIS:  Be careful. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Something interesting just happened. <br/>
TORRES: What's that? <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Seven of Nine requested a duty assignment. <br/>
TORRES: Fascinating. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: She wants to work in Engineering. <br/>
TORRES: What? <br/>
CHAKOTAY: The Borg use transwarp conduits to travel through space
faster than warp speed. If we could create one of them. <br/>
TORRES: We don't know anything about transwarp technology. Playing
around with it could be dangerous. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: That's where Seven of Nine comes in. She's offered to work
with you. <br/>
TORRES: What do you think her real motives are? <br/>
CHAKOTAY: She's having a tough time making the transition from the
Collective. She wants something to do. <br/>
TORRES: I never thought of you as naive, Chakotay. The bottom line is,
I don't want her working in Engineering. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: The bottom line is, I'm giving you an order and you're going
to follow it, Lieutenant. <br/>
TORRES: Whatever you say, sir. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Seven of Nine, you told me you wouldn't make any more attempts
to contact the Borg. I want to believe that's true. <br/>
SEVEN: I assure you it is. <br/>
JANEWAY: I've decided not to post a security detail while you're in
Engineering, but you have to realise there are rules. You'll be
expected to follow our protocols. You'll report directly to Lieutenant
Torres and obey any order she gives you. <br/>
SEVEN: I understand. <br/>
JANEWAY: One more thing. Your designation, Seven of Nine, it's a little
cumbersome. Wouldn't you prefer to be called by your given name,
Annika? <br/>
SEVEN: I have been Seven of Nine for as long as I can remember. <br/>
JANEWAY: All right. But maybe we could streamline it a little. How
would you feel about Seven? <br/>
SEVEN: Imprecise, but acceptable. <br/>
TUVOK [OC]: Tuvok to Captain Janeway. <br/>
JANEWAY: Yes, Tuvok. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Please come to the bridge. A ship is approaching. <br/>(Janeway enters, with Seven following.)<br/>TUVOK: It's damaged but
functional. Energy emissions are so low, it's probably not capable of
warp speed. Several dozen lifesigns aboard. We are being hailed,
Captain. <br/>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation starship Voyager. <br/>
RAHMIN [on viewscreen]: I am Rahmin. My people are the Caatati. I
apologise for our appearance and the condition of our ship. Most of our
people were assimilated by the Borg over a year ago. We lost
everything. <br/>
JANEWAY: How many of you escaped? <br/>
RAHMIN [on viewscreen]: A few thousand on thirty ships. All that's left
from a planet of millions. <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry. <br/>
RAHMIN [on viewscreen]: Captain, I want to assure you, my people were
once proud and accomplished. <br/>
JANEWAY: I understand. <br/>
RAHMIN [on viewscreen]: It pains me to have to ask this, but I have
eighty eight people to care for on this vessel. We need food,
medicines. Is there any way you could help us? <br/>
JANEWAY: Of course. Send us a list of your needs and we'll see what we
can do. <br/>
RAHMIN [on viewscreen]: I'm deeply grateful. If it's not too much to
ask, is there any way you might also spare a small quantity of
thorium isotopes? Without them, our systems can't function. <br/>
JANEWAY: I think we can arrange that. I'll speak to my engineer. <br/>
RAHMIN [on viewscreen]: You can't imagine what this means to us,
Captain. Thank you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Seven is working at the warp core console.)<br/>TORRES:
How are those thorium isotopes coming, Vorik? <br/>
VORIK: I'll admit I'm having trouble controlling the neutron
absorption. <br/>
TORRES: Try increasing the temperature of the plasma. Get the thorium
to the captain as soon as it's ready. <br/>
VORIK: Of course. <br/>
TORRES: Tell me something. When you hear about people like the Caatati,
do you have any feelings of remorse? <br/>
SEVEN: No. <br/>
TORRES: That's it? Just no? <br/>
SEVEN: What further answer do you require? <br/>
TORRES: Oh, maybe some kind of acknowledgement of the billions of
lives you helped destroy. A justification for what you did. Maybe a
little sense of guilt? <br/>
SEVEN: Guilt is irrelevant. <br/>
TORRES: Heartwarming. <br/>
SEVEN: I've set the parameters for the tachyon bursts we'll need to
create a transwarp conduit. It will be several hours before the main
deflector can be modified. I think it would be best if I waited in my
alcove. <br/>

If I ever saw a job for the morale officer, it's sitting right here.
I'll bet I can help. <br/>
TORRES: You're facing a big challenge, Neelix. <br/>
NEELIX: I enjoy a challenge. <br/>(He produces a dish from behind his back.)<br/>
TORRES: Is that supposed to make me feel better? <br/>
NEELIX: Blood pie, for the Day of Honour. <br/>
TORRES: How did you know about that? Has Tom been talking to you? <br/>
NEELIX: Not at all. No, I make it a point to know these things. And
if I'm correct, many Klingon families traditionally serve blood pie on
the Day of Honour. <br/>
TORRES: I appreciate the gesture, Neelix, but I've decided to ignore
this particular tradition. No blood pie, no examining my behaviour over
the last year to see if I measure up to Klingon standards. <br/>
NEELIX: Understood. Lieutenant, without knowing why there's a black
cloud hanging over your head, may I suggest something? <br/>
TORRES: Go right ahead. <br/>
NEELIX: You have a bit of a temper that you keep reined in, and
sometimes it builds up inside you until you explode at someone. <br/>
TORRES: I'd say that about sums it up. <br/>
NEELIX: I'm offering to be a pressure valve. <br/>
TORRES: What? <br/>
NEELIX: You may use me to blow off steam. When you're angry, come see
me. Call me names, insult me, question my parentage. I won't take it
personally. And you won't need to keep things bottled up inside
anymore. <br/>
TORRES: That may be the nicest offer I've had in a long time. Thank
you, Neelix. You're sweet, but I'm not sure I could do that to you. <br/>
NEELIX: I'm here if you need me. <br/>
TORRES: Neelix. About this Day of Honour. Do you think I should go
through with it? <br/>
NEELIX: I've always thought traditions were good things, worth
preserving. <br/>
TORRES: I've been thinking a lot about the rituals that my mother taught me,
and they don't seem quite so hateful as they did when I was a child.
Maybe being so far away from anything Klingon has changed me. <br/>
NEELIX: It certainly can't hurt to go through with the ceremony. <br/>
TORRES: I don't know what effect it'll have on me. That's what's
frightening. All right, bring on the blood pie. I can do this.<br/>(She takes a spoonful. Her expression suggests eating it is an ordeal in itself.) </font></p>

Qapla'! What warrior goes there! <br/>
TORRES: My name's B'Elanna. <br/>
MOKLOR: Do you come to have your honour challenged? <br/>
TORRES: I guess so. Yes. <br/>
MOKLOR: Are you willing to see the ceremony through to the end? <br/>
TORRES: That's the idea, isn't it? What do I do? <br/>
MOKLOR: It will be a lengthy ordeal. First, you must eat from the heart
of a sanctified targ. <br/>(Another Klingon brings a dish and Torres takes a piece.)<br/>MOKLOR: Pak'logh! Yes, the heart of targ brings courage
to one who eats it. Next, you will drink mot'lach from the Grail of
Kahless. Drink to the glory of Kahless, the greatest warrior of all
time! <br/>(Torres drinks, and coughs.)<br/>MOKLOR: Kahless defeated his enemies on the field of battle and built a
mighty empire. How have you proven yourself worthy? <br/>
TORRES: I haven't built any empires, and I can't say that I've
personally defeated any enemies in battle, but you have to realise I'm
not living among warriors. <br/>
MOKLOR: Then how do you expect to distinguish yourself? <br/>
TORRES: I don't know. I guess I'm doing the best I can. <br/>
MOKLOR: Huh. A pitiful reply. Let us proceed. A warrior must endure great
hardship. To test your mettle you will endure the ritual of twenty
pain-sticks. After that, you will engage in combat with a master of the
bat'leth. Finally, you will traverse the sulphur lagoons of Gorath.<br/>
TORRES: You know, I don't think so. I didn't want to do this before you
described it. Certainly not now. I'm leaving. <br/>
MOKLOR: Not until you have completed the ceremony, p'tach. <br/>(They jab Torres with pain sticks. She gasps and falls to her knees, then attacks Moklor.)<br/>

Come in. <br/>
PARIS: I tried to find you before, but you were on the holodeck. <br/>
TORRES: That's right. <br/>
PARIS: You know, you left it running. There was a Klingon in there who
didn't look too happy. <br/>
TORRES: Really? <br/>
PARIS: Yeah, and he was nursing a whale of a black eye. Looked like
he'd had a run in with someone having a really bad day. <br/>
TORRES: That's very funny. <br/>
PARIS: So, how'd it go? <br/>
TORRES: It didn't. Do you mind if we talk about something else? <br/>
PARIS: As a matter of fact I do. You have been like a spitting cobra
all day and it's getting boring. You know, we designed that holodeck
programme together, and I think you owe me the courtesy of telling me
what happened. <br/>
TORRES: It was ridiculous, meaningless posturing. Honour, dishonour,
what does it matter? <br/>
PARIS: It matters because it's part of who you are. You've been running
away from that your whole life. <br/>
TORRES: Who are you to tell me that? <br/>
PARIS: I care about you, but if you're going to keep pushing me away
then there's no point in my staying around, is there? <br/>
TORRES: Fine! Just leave me alone. <br/>
PARIS: Don't worry. If this is the way you treat people who try to be
your friend, you'll be alone all right. </font></p>

LUMAS:
There are over two hundred people on our three ships alone. Everyone of
them suffers from malnourishment, but it's been hardest on the
children. Every parent sacrifices for their child, but even so, there's
not enough food. If you could hear the crying of the babies, you would
have as much trouble sleeping at night as I do. <br/>
TUVOK: Have you considered relocation to a planet where you could grow
your own food? <br/>
LUMAS: Of course, but we haven't been welcomed anywhere. Because we
have no resources everyone treats us like vagrants, even criminals. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: We're not unsympathetic, but we have limited supplies. We
can't possibly provide enough for all your people. <br/>LUMAS: Forgive me but, from my perspective you live in luxury. You
don't suffer from debilitating diseases. You have many sources of
energy. Replicators. Your crew is very well fed. Apparently, keeping
your bellies full is more important to you than helping those less
fortunate. <br/>
NEELIX: That's unfair. These are the most generous people you could
hope to meet. But if we gave supplies to everyone who asked, we
wouldn't have anything left. <br/>
JANEWAY: Neelix, how much food can we spare? <br/>
NEELIX: We could provide each ship with several hundred kilograms. <br/>
JANEWAY: Do it, and check with the Doctor to see if he can spare any
medical supplies. <br/>

just come along and rescue us. There must be something we can do. <br/>
PARIS: Agreed. If we could interplex the comm. systems in both suits we
might be able to create a phased carrier wave. Voyager would read the
signature and know it's from us. <br/>
TORRES: Good idea. Let me access your controls. <br/>
PARIS: I thought you'd never ask. <br/>(He pulls on her lifeline to bring her close in.)<br/>
TORRES: That's it. This would be a lot easier if I had a hyperspanner.
Hold still. <br/>
PARIS: Why is it we have to get beamed into space in environmental
suits before I can initiate first contact procedures? <br/>
TORRES: Why is it that if we're alone for more than thirty seconds you
start thinking about contact? <br/>
PARIS: Ah, that is not fair. The other day in Engineering I must have
gone four minutes before I started thinking about it. <br/>
TORRES: Okay, I'm ready to initiate the carrier wave. <br/>(A high pitched buzzing that hurts the ears.)<br/>
PARIS: Ah! Ah! <br/>
TORRES: Sorry. Better? <br/>
PARIS: Yeah. Let's hope it's still that strong by the time it gets to
Voyager. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Come in. Would you like tea or coffee? <br/>
SEVEN: I have no need to ingest liquids. I still receive energy from
the Borg alcove. <br/>
JANEWAY: My understanding is that you're almost ready to begin eating
food. <br/>
SEVEN: That is what the doctor says. Why have you asked me here? <br/>
JANEWAY: Whenever there's an accident on the ship, even a minor one, we
investigate it in order to minimise the chances of its
happening again. <br/>
SEVEN: A prudent course of action. <br/>
JANEWAY: I didn't have a chance to talk to Lieutenant Torres before she
left the ship, so I wanted to ask you some questions about what
happened in Engineering. Sensor logs indicate the tachyons were leaking
into the warp core. Do you have any idea how it started? <br/>
SEVEN: No. We had reconfigured the deflector shield to emit tachyon
bursts. The procedure must have triggered the leak. <br/>
JANEWAY: Who was controlling the tachyon bursts? <br/>
SEVEN: Ensign Vorik. <br/>
JANEWAY: What were you doing? <br/>
SEVEN: Monitoring the transwarp frequencies. <br/>
JANEWAY: And did you at any time access deflector control? <br/>
SEVEN: You believe I'm responsible for the accident. That I
deliberately sabotaged the ship. You are like the others, you see me as
a threat. <br/>
JANEWAY: I won't lie to you. Part of me is suspicious. We've dealt with
tachyon fields before and never had this kind of problem. <br/>
SEVEN: Captain. I am unaccustomed to deception. Among the Borg it was
impossible. There were no lies, no secrets. And I assure you I had
nothing to do with the accident in Engineering. <br/>
JANEWAY: I believe you. Thank you. <br/>
SEVEN: I am finding it a difficult challenge to integrate into this
group. It is full of complex social structures that are unfamiliar to
me. Compared with the Borg, this crew is inefficient and contentious,
but it is capable of surprising acts of compassion. <br/>
JANEWAY: Unexpected acts of kindness are common among our group. That's
one of the ways we define ourselves. <br/>
SEVEN: Is there anything more? <br/>
JANEWAY: Yes. We still have to find out what caused the tachyon leak.
Tell me what you remember about the power fluctuations in the
propulsion system. </font></p>

This isn't anything like the simulations we had at the Academy. They
felt peaceful, like floating in the womb. But right now I'm feeling a
little sick to my stomach. <br/>
PARIS: You dropped out too soon. In the third year there's a six week
course of actual spacewalks so you can get used to them. <br/>
TORRES: I never would have lasted to the third year. If I hadn't
dropped out, they would have asked me to leave. <br/>
PARIS: I wish I'd known you then. <br/>
TORRES: You'd have hated me. <br/>
PARIS: I can't imagine a time I wouldn't have found you fascinating.
<br/>(A bright light happens nearby.)<br/>PARIS: What the hell was that? <br/>

PARIS: Yes. Much better. Thanks. What's wrong? <br/>
TORRES: The turbulence must have damaged my suit too. I should have at
least twenty four hours worth of oxygen, but there's only about a half
hour left. </font></p>

SEVEN: Captain, I believe I've found the cause of the accident. Erratic
fluctuations in the ship's warp power. When tachyon levels rose to a
resonant frequency, core pressure increased. <br/>
JANEWAY: Then it was an accident. Come in. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, we've picked up a carrier wave with a Starfleet
signature. I'd guess it's Tom and B'Elanna, but they're not answering

JANEWAY: You've brought some friends. <br/>LUMAS [on viewscreen]: Needy friends. We're hoping you will offer us
more supplies. <br/>
JANEWAY: I made it clear last time that we couldn't possibly you with
enough for all your ships. <br/>LUMAS [on viewscreen]: And I had to accept that because your ship is
more powerful than ours. But the situation has changed, hasn't it? You
seem to be at a disadvantage now. We have your warp core. You can't
escape. I'm hoping that'll make you more generous. <br/>
JANEWAY: We've given you everything we can spare. Return the core and
we'll be on our way. <br/>LUMAS [on viewscreen]: One of our ships might not seem threatening to
you, but I assure you, twenty seven can inflict considerable damage. We
are desperate. Prepare to send us food, weapons, and your entire supply
of thorium. And that Borg you're protecting. We want her too. There are
many who'd enjoy a chance to repay one of them for what they did to us.

I'm lowering the oxygen ratio. That should give us a few more minutes. <br/>

TORRES: Well, now's the time. <br/>
PARIS: When we first met, you didn't have a very high opinion of me. <br/>

absorbed pig. <br/>

changed? <br/>

There I go again, just pushing you away. You were right about me. It's
what I do, push people away. <br/>

KIM: Maybe if we give them something? <br/>
JANEWAY: Like what? I can't imagine what would satisfy them now. <br/>

they'll let you leave. <br/>
JANEWAY: That's very generous, but I will not turn you over to them. <br/>
SEVEN: I was only offering to do what would be best for this group. <br/>
JANEWAY: You're part of this group now and we're going to protect you.
It's time to stop talking about this. Tom and B'Elanna are in trouble
and we have to find them. Tuvok, what's the status of our weapons
array? <br/>
TUVOK: Weapons are at the ready, Captain, but our shield strength is
extremely low. <br/>
JANEWAY: We'll have to shut down non-essential systems. Reroute power
to the shields. We're going to fight. <br/>
SEVEN: That might not be necessary. Caatati technology is dependent on
thorium isotopes. If they had enough they could become self-sustaining.
<br/>
KIM: But we don't have that much thorium to give them. <br/>
SEVEN: When the Borg assimilated the Caatati, the survivors lost their
ability to replicate the isotopes. But I have retained that knowledge.
I could design an energy matrix that would produce thorium in large
quantities. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: If you've had this knowledge all along, why didn't you say
so? <br/>
SEVEN: I am not accustomed to thinking that way. Borg do not consider
giving technology away, only assimilating it. <br/>
JANEWAY: And what do you suppose made you consider it now? <br/>
SEVEN: I am not certain. <br/>
JANEWAY: Maybe it was just an unexpected act of kindness. Work with
Vorik to build the energy matrix, while I convince the Caatati there's a
better way out of this. </font></p>
