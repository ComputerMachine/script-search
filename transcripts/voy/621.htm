You're late. <br/>
MINER 2: There was a problem with the pulse drills on level four. <br/>
MINER 1: They're going to be here any moment. I want to make a good
impression. <br/>
MINER 2: You're certain we should be doing this? <br/>
MINER 1: Orek will be pleased that we took the initiative. <br/>
MINER 2: I hope you're right. <br/>(Two figures in Starfleet uniforms beam in.)<br/>
MINER 1: Welcome to Telsius.<br/>
DALA: Thank you. I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway. This is Commander Tuvok.
We're from the Federation Starship Voyager. <br/>(The
resemblances are close, but not quite right. Janeway's hair is too
think, Tuvok is too stocky and the comm. badges are much bigger.)<br/>DALA: We have several mines like
this on Earth. <br/>
MINER 1: I'm not familiar with Earth. <br/>
DALA: That's because it's thirty thousand light years from here. <br/>
MOBAR: Thirty thousand three hundred forty two point four to be exact.<br/>
MINER 1: You're a long way from home. <br/>
DALA: It's difficult sometimes, then I close my eyes and think of the
farm in Indiana where I grew up. For a moment I'm home again. Shall
we get down to business? <br/>
MINER 1: Yes. We've had a shortage of dilithium for the last two
months. If we can't replenish our supply we may be forced to suspend
work. <br/>
MINER 2: Our chief of mining operations has gone to the Grenna system. <br/>
MINER 1: Yes, but we are authorised to conduct trades in his absence. <br/>
MOBAR: What are you prepared to trade? <br/>
MINER 1: I'm afraid the only commodity we have is, er, bolomite. <br/>
DALA: We really don't have much use for that. <br/>
MOBAR: On the contrary, Captain. Bolomite is used in omega radiation
therapy. The orphans on Narva<br/>
MINER 1: Orphans?<br/>
MOBAR: The settlers on the Narva colony were exposed to toxic levels of
omega radiation. The entire adult population was killed. <br/>
DALA: We're doing all we can for the children. All right, twenty
kilotons of dilithium for an equivalent amount of bolomite. <br/>
MINER 1: We only have ten kilotons left. <br/>
DALA: Then ten it is. <br/>
MOBAR: Captain, I must point out that dilithium is worth nearly twice
as much as bolomite. <br/>
DALA: Tuvok, these people need our help. I'm not going to quibble over
a few tons of ore. <br/>
MINER 2: Perhaps we should celebrate. <br/>
DALA: I wish we could, but there's a neutronic storm approaching our
ship. We should be leaving orbit. <br/>
MINER 1: Give us an hour to finalise the arrangements. <br/>
DALA: We'll be waiting to hear from you. <br/>
MOBAR: Before we leave, would it be possible to tour your facility?
It's our duty as Starfleet officers <br/>
DALA: Unfortunately the storm won't wait. Maybe on our next visit. <br/>(Mobar gives the Vulcan salute.)<br/>

Ugh! This hair is so uncomfortable. <br/>(She removes the wig.)<br/>
MOBAR: I find it aesthetically pleasing. <br/>
ZAR: The negotiations?<br/>
DALA: It would've been perfect if Tuvok hadn't decided to improvise. <br/>
MOBAR: I was portraying my character as truthfully as possible. <br/>
DALA: Once we finish a transaction, we leave. Is that clear? <br/>
MOBAR: Indeed. <br/>

you for your generosity. <br/>

dilithium yet. <br/>

transporters. If we don't leave orbit immediately, we will sustain heavy
damage. <br/>

can't seem to isolate the problem. <br/>

KIM: I'd like to claim credit, but I'm innocent. <br/>
TUVOK: The next time I visit the holodeck, I expect to find my

appear you've been cheated, but not by me or anyone one on my crew. <br/>

you try to convince me you're the victims here. <br/>

Nice hair. <br/>
DALA: It's not really my taste. <br/>
JANEWAY: Posing as a Starfleet captain, selling memberships to the
Federation. Too bad we didn't think of it, Tuvok. Imagine the resources
we could have acquired over the past six years. <br/>
TUVOK: Indeed. <br/>
JANEWAY: I have to admit, I'm impressed. <br/>
DALA: I wish I could say the same. The great Captain Janeway. Somehow I
expected you to be taller. I make a better you than you. <br/>
JANEWAY: Oh I don't know, I'd say we're very much alike. Resourceful,
intelligent, ambitious. But with just one tiny difference. <br/>
DALA: And what is that?<br/>
JANEWAY: I'm not a liar and a thief. You're going to give me a detailed
account of everyone you cheated, and exactly what you did with their
property. <br/>
DALA: Why would I do that? <br/>
JANEWAY: Because if you don't, I'm turning you over to Telsian
security. <br/>
DALA: Oh, is that supposed to frighten me? <br/>
JANEWAY: How much do you know about the Telsians? <br/>
DALA: Just that they're a more gullible species than most. <br/>
JANEWAY: Tell her about your research, Mister Tuvok. <br/>
TUVOK: I beg your pardon, Captain? <br/>
JANEWAY: On Telsian law. I think it's only fair that we let our guest
know what to expect. <br/>
TUVOK: The Telsian criminal justice system is rather barbaric. <br/>
JANEWAY: Tell her about the prisons. <br/>
TUVOK: Barely habitable. Inmates often die of malnutrition before they
are brought to trial. Torture is commonplace, as is disease, including
several incurable forms of psoriasis. <br/>
JANEWAY: I think she gets the general idea. <br/>
DALA: Suppose I do tell you. How do I know you won't turn me over to
the Telsians anyway? <br/>
JANEWAY: If you make full restitution to your victims, I'll give you
safe passage out of this area. <br/>
DALA: Is that a promise, Captain? <br/>
JANEWAY: I know it's hard for you to believe, but occasionally some of
us tell the truth. <br/>
DALA: Give me the Delta Flyer and three days to get as far away from
here as I can, and then I'll send you the information you want. <br/>
JANEWAY: How naive do you think I am? <br/>
DALA: As far as the victims are concerned, you're the one who cheated
them. Without my help, you'll be the one who has a problem leaving this

TUVOK: Improvisation is not foremost among my talents. <br/>
JANEWAY: Considering I caught you off guard, I thought your performance
was exemplary. <br/>
TUVOK: Thank you, Captain. Was your order to call the Telsians part of
the deception or did you actually want me to contact them? <br/>
JANEWAY: Not yet. Let's give Dala some time to think about those
barbaric prisons. <br/>
TUVOK: Do you believe she'll relent? <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm not sure. Something tells me she's just as stubborn as I
am. <br/>

NEELIX: Do you ever feel guilty? Taking advantage of people who
actually think that you care about them? <br/>

NEELIX: Actually, I think you're just sorry you got caught. <br/>
DALA: Probably. <br/>
NEELIX: There. Now you're being honest. I knew it was possible. If you
don't mind my asking, why do you do what you do?<br/>
DALA: My father taught me most people will exploit you if they can. So,
it's best to exploit them first. <br/>
NEELIX: You know, I used to be a lot like you. Living by my wits. Never
trusting anyone. Always trying to end up on the more profitable side of
a transaction.<br/>
DALA: And now you don't hesitate to help starving orphans. <br/>
NEELIX: I changed. When Captain Janeway made me part of the crew. <br/>
DALA: I suppose you suddenly reformed. <br/>
NEELIX: No, no. Not right away. <br/>(He sits next to Dala.) <br/>NEELIX: At first I was
just exploiting an opportunity to get a warm bed, food, protection. I
kept waiting to find out what the captain wanted in return. <br/>
DALA: But she never asked for a thing. <br/>
NEELIX: On the contrary. She expected a great deal from me. Honesty,
loyalty, hard work. <br/>
DALA: I should've guessed. <br/>
NEELIX: But I discovered that those were commodities I had in
abundance. And it was much more profitable to share them than it was to
be self-serving and cynical all the time. I'm happier than I've ever
been. <br/>
DALA: I suppose that you think I could change too. <br/>
NEELIX: Stranger things have happened. <br/>
DALA: Do you really think that she'll give me safe passage if I make
restitution? <br/>
NEELIX: If that's what she promised you.<br/>
DALA: Then what? I have never done anything else. <br/>
NEELIX: Captain Janeway let Seven of Nine remain on board, and she was
Borg. <br/>
DALA: Are you saying she'd do the same thing for me? <br/>
NEELIX: I'd be willing to talk to her. <br/>
DALA: I cheated you. Why are you being so kind to me? <br/>
NEELIX: Like my great grandmother used to say, it's nice to be nice. <br/>
DALA: Is that tea still warm? <br/>(Neelix stands and pours her a cup.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> She drops it.</font><font face="Arial" size="2">)<br/>DALA: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so clumsy! <br/>(Neelix bends to mop up the liquid. She hits him on the back of the neck, grabs his phaser and shoots the guard.)<br/>
