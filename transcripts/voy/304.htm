TUVOK: Your serve? <br/>
JANEWAY: Tennis. After nineteen years I've decided to take it up again.
I'm a little rusty. I played in a novice tournament on the holodeck. I
lost my first match in straight sets. <br/>
TUVOK: Perhaps if you maintained eye contact with the ball at the apex
of its trajectory, your serve would be more effective. <br/>
JANEWAY: You play tennis. <br/>
TUVOK: Simple physics, Captain. <br/>
JANEWAY: Not as simple as when I played on the High School tennis team.
What can I do for you, Tuvok? <br/>

JANEWAY: Report. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Some sort of spatial rift. It opened right in front of us. <br/>
JANEWAY: Analysis. <br/>
KIM: It's a distortion in the space-time continuum, but it's got a
graviton matrix. It's being artificially generated. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: By whom? <br/>
KIM: Sensors can't get inside. The distortion field's fluctuating.
Something's coming out. <br/>
TUVOK: It appears to be a small ship, approximately six metres in
length. <br/>
JANEWAY: Magnify. <br/>
TUVOK: Sensors are reading one occupant, human. He is holding position
at the perimeter of the rift. <br/>
KIM: There's a subspace signature emanating from the ship. Captain,
it's Federation! <br/>
JANEWAY: Hail them. <br/>
TUVOK: No response. They appear to be charging weapons. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Shields up! Hail them again. <br/>
(Whumph!) <br/>
TUVOK: Shields are down. <br/>
JANEWAY: Get us out of here. <br/>
PARIS: Helm control is offline. <br/>
KIM: He's firing some kind of sub-atomic disruptor. <br/>
JANEWAY: Return fire. <br/>
TUVOK: Full phasers. No effect. <br/>
KIM: Voyager's molecular structure is coming apart! <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, divert all available power to the deflector. Send out
a high energy polaron pulse. It might help to disrupt his weapon. <br/>
TUVOK: Emitting deflector pulse now. <br/>
KIM: It's working. <br/>
TUVOK: We are being hailed. <br/>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br/>
BRAXTON [on viewscreen]: Starship Voyager, I'm Captain Braxton of the
Federation Timeship Aeon. I've come from twenty-ninth century Earth,
five hundred years into your future. Please disengage your deflector
pulse. <br/>
JANEWAY: Why are you firing at us? <br/>
BRAXTON [on viewscreen]: Your vessel is responsible for a disaster in
my century. A temporal explosion that will destroy all Earth's solar
system. I've come back in time to prevent that occurrence. My mission
is your destruction. You must not resist. <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm going to need some more information before I allow you to <br/>
BRAXTON [on viewscreen]: Debris from your secondary hull was found in
the explosion. <br/>
JANEWAY: Captain, I simply <br/>
BRAXTON [on viewscreen]: No time! <br/>
(Whumph!) <br/>
TUVOK: He's remodulating the sub-atomic disruptor. Our deflector is
losing power, it won't hold much longer. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, if he's telling the truth <br/>
JANEWAY: I won't sacrifice this crew based on a ten second
conversation. I need proof. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: It doesn't look like we're going to get it. <br/>
JANEWAY: Adjust our deflector to match the frequency of his weapon. Try
to overload his emitter. <br/>
TUVOK: It seems to be working. His weapon is offline and his ship has
been damaged. The rift is destabilising and he's being pulled back
inside. <br/>
JANEWAY: Re-establish helm control. <br/>
PARIS: I'm trying, Captain, but we seem to be caught in some kind of
graviton distortion. We're being pulled in too. <br/>
(The two ships fall into the rift. After some shaking and a white-out,
in which everyone loses consciousness, they awake in normal space.) <br/>
JANEWAY: Status. <br/>
TUVOK: Primary systems are coming back online. The weapons array and
power grid took heavy damage. <br/>
KIM: The temporal rift is closed. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Where are we? <br/>
(The viewscreen shows a blue planet with white clouds.) <br/>
PARIS: Home. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: We just cut across half the galaxy! <br/>
JANEWAY: The rift must have originated here. Hail Starfleet Command. <br/>
TUVOK: No response on standard frequencies. Curious. I am picking up a
multitude of narrow band EM signals. <br/>
JANEWAY: Let's hear it. <br/>
(A cacophony of radio stations and telephone conversations.) <br/>
JANEWAY: The question isn't where we are, it's when we are. Mister Kim.
<br/>
KIM: According to astrometric readings the year is 1996. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: The late twentieth century. <br/>
PARIS: Captain, they had surveillance satellites during this time. <br/>
JANEWAY: Maintain a high orbit. And modulate the shields to scatter
their radar. We don't want to alarm the natives. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: What about the time ship? Is it here too? <br/>
TUVOK: There is no sign of the vessel in orbit. Scanning the planet
surface. I am picking up low frequency subspace readings emanating from
the northern hemisphere. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Subspace technology shouldn't exist for another hundred years
or so. <br/>
JANEWAY: It could be our friend from the twenty ninth century. Localise
it. <br/>
TUVOK: North American continent, Pacific coast. The city of Los
Angeles. <br/>
JANEWAY: We've got to go down there. If it is Captain Braxton, he's the
key to all this, and at the moment his ship is the only way we have of
getting back to our own century. Chakotay, Tuvok, Paris, you're with
me. Mister Kim, you have the bridge. <br/>
KIM: Yes, Ma'am! <br/>
JANEWAY: As I recall, Tom, you're something of an aficionado on
twentieth century America. <br/>
PARIS: That's right. <br/>
JANEWAY: What will we need to pass as locals in this era? <br/>
PARIS: Simple. Nice clothes, fast car and lots of money. </font></p>

would have noticed. <br/>

JANEWAY: The subspace readings are coming from within a one hundred
metre radius of our position, but I can't pinpoint the source. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: I find it hard to believe a ship from the twenty ninth
century could have landed on this beach without being noticed. <br/>
JANEWAY: We have no idea what kind of technology they might have in the
future. Maybe it's cloaked. Let's spread out. Tuvok, Paris, go check
the shoreline. Chakotay and I will search the boardwalk. <br/>

CHAKOTAY: Well, Kathryn, you got us home. <br/>
JANEWAY: Right place, wrong time. But it is good to be back,
nevertheless. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe I should look up a few ancestors. As I recall, one of
them was a schoolteacher in Arizona. <br/>

history. <br/>
GIRL ON BLADES: Coming through. Sorry. <br/>

CHAKOTAY: No. <br/>
JANEWAY: After the Hermosa quake in 2047 this entire region sank under
two hundred metres of water. It became one of the world's largest coral
reefs, home to thousands of different marine species. <br/>

listen to me. Bo, you were too concerned with yourselves! <br/>

reaction that started with Voyager! It's too late now. All things are

BRAXTON: Pure chance. When you knocked my navigational system off
course there's no telling where we may have ended up. Who's been here?
Who took my pencils? Oh, always something missing. Oh, always trying to
steal things. Oh, greedy people. Post-industrial barbarians! <br/>
JANEWAY: Captain, we want to help you, but you've got to give us more
information. You said that Voyager causes the explosion. <br/>
BRAXTON: Yes. No. Yes. That's the paradox, my dear. A leads to B leads
to C leads to A. Juvenile minds. Oh, how can I make you understand,
huh? A. There's an explosion in the twenty ninth century. Debris from
Voyager's hull is found in evidence. I go back in time to destroy you.
B. You try to stop me, disabling my weapon which causes me to
crash-land back here in the twentieth century. C. Someone in this
century steals my timeship and launches it. They go into the future and
once there they make one critical mistake which causes a terrible
explosion that takes us all the way back to A. There's an explosion in
the twenty ninth century. The cycle of causality is complete. <br/>
JANEWAY: How do you know all this? What evidence do you have that it
will be your timeship that causes the disaster? <br/>
(Braxton rummages for a piece of brown paper.) <br/>
BRAXTON: Ah, I've spent thirty years answering that very question. Ah,
yes, when the explosion first happened, my sensors recorded a whole
variety of chronometric data. The pulses were highly chaotic. At first
I thought it was a warp core implosion, but then I found debris from
Voyager and my theory seemed to be confirmed. It was you. But then
someone here stole my timeship and it started to dawn on me. If someone
were to fly my timeship into the future without recalibrating the
temporal matrix then that could cause the kind of explosion that I
witnessed in the twenty ninth century. <br/>
JANEWAY: So it really wasn't Voyager after all. <br/>
BRAXTON: No. No, no, I reconstructed all the chronometric data as best
I could remember it and it proved I was right. My ship causes the
catastrophe. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Which raises the question, who has your timeship? <br/>
BRAXTON: Starling. Henry Starling, CEO Chronowerx Industries.
Philanthropist, entrepreneur, outstanding citizen. Pa! Before I crashed
in 1967 I made an emergency beam out, but he found my ship before I did
in some remote mountain range. I've been following this corrupt little
man ever since, tracking his movements. He's become too powerful. I
can't get close to him. Of course, you can't accomplish anything in
this wretched century. Nobody here listens. Do you know that once they
put me in a mental institution and filled me with primitive
pharmaceuticals. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe we can help you find Starling and your ship, and get us
back to where we belong. <br/>
BRAXTON: Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you. <br/>
JANEWAY: Why not? <br/>
BRAXTON: Haven't you been listening? A leads to B <br/>
JANEWAY: Leads to C. Yes, we heard you. Why shouldn't we try to stop
Starling? <br/>
BRAXTON: Because somehow you're involved in the disaster. That's why I
found debris from Voyager's hull at the explosion. You will be
destroyed as well. <br/>

out <br/>

none of this would have happened. <br/>

fraudulent. However I've also been monitoring more official channels
and the United States military is taking things just a little more
seriously. <br/>

STARLING: How's it going? <br/>
EMH: I find your interest in my well-being to be less than genuine. <br/>
STARLING: Try to be a little more grateful, Doc. The schematics I
downloaded from your ship indicate you were stuck in the sickbay twenty
four hours a day. <br/>
EMH: I recently suffered a severe programme loss and I'm still in the
process of retrieving my memory files, but apparently on a few
occasions I have been projected into other locations. Undoubtedly
you're using a similar procedure. <br/>
STARLING: My holographic simulator. We use it to test our new microchip
designs. I projected you through the emitters in the office. Your
programme really isn't very sophisticated. <br/>
EMH: That is a matter of opinion. Now would you please return me to my
vessel. <br/>
STARLING: Can't do that. Not yet. I've a few questions I want answered.
<br/>
EMH: If you have need of medical expertise, I would refer you to a more
local physician. <br/>
STARLING: All Captain Janeway's talk of a disaster I caused is just
smoke. You came here to steal my timeship. <br/>
EMH: That is simply not the case. <br/>
STARLING: That timeship is from the twenty ninth century. Technology
five hundred years more advanced than anything you've got. You'd love
to get your hands on it. You figured I'd be any easy target. Some
backwards twentieth century Neanderthal that doesn't know what he's
got. But you found out otherwise, didn't you? <br/>
EMH: A paranoid response indicative of bipolar personality disorder. If
my history is accurate, southern California in the late twentieth
century had no shortage of psychotherapists, competent and otherwise. I
suggest you find one. Now, return me to Voyager. <br/>
STARLING: I've learned your weapons are damaged, your ship's
teleporter's half shot, but I didn't get all the personnel files. I
have to know my enemy. Give me Captain Janeway's psychological profile.
<br/>
EMH: I'm a doctor, not a database. <br/>
STARLING: I'd say you're a little bit of both. Start talking. <br/>
EMH: Or suffer the consequences? Hardly. I'm a hologram. I experience
neither pain nor fear of death. You have no means of coercing me. <br/>
(Starling taps a key and proves him wrong.) <br/>
STARLING: Pain. It's an interesting sensation, isn't it. <br/>
EMH: I, I never realised. <br/>
STARLING: How unpleasant it could be? This is what burning feels like.
For a human to experience what you're going through right now, he'd
have to be on fire. <br/>
(Starling turns it off, and the EMH falls to the carpet.) <br/>
EMH: How? <br/>
STARLING: By reconfiguring your tactile response sensors. Easy as
proverbial pie. Feeling more co-operative? <br/>

BRAXTON [on viewscreen]: Do you know me? <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Yes, unfortunately. <br/>
JANEWAY: You tried to destroy our ship in the twenty fourth century and
the next time we saw you, you were an old man, homeless, in 1996. <br/>
BRAXTON [on viewscreen]: I never experienced that timeline. <br/>
PARIS: Then what are you doing here? <br/>
BRAXTON [on viewscreen]: In my century we can scan time, much as you
use sensors to scan space. The Temporal Integrity Commission detected
your vessel over twentieth century Earth. I was sent to correct that
anomaly. Prepare to follow me back into the rift. I'm returning you to
your own time, to your previous coordinates in the Delta Quadrant. <br/>
JANEWAY: Captain, we've been trying to get home to Earth for the last
two years. Can you return us to our century but keep us here, in the
Alpha Quadrant? <br/>

afraid you're on your own. Braxton out. <br/>

EMH: If you're referring to my new found mobility, that is entirely up
to me. <br/>
TORRES: I'm still trying to figure out exactly how the Doctor's
autonomous emitter works, but it looks like downloading him back into
the ship's computer isn't going to be much of a problem. <br/>
EMH: Apparently the reverse is also true. I will be able to make use of
the emitter as casually as you might slip on a pair of shoes. <br/>
TORRES: It's a little more involved than that. <br/>
EMH: You know, Kes, now that I'll be to and fro, your responsibilities
in sickbay will increase. <br/>
KES: I'm up to the challenge, Doctor, but what about you? There's going
to be more to your life than sickbay. <br/>
EMH: Nothing I can't handle. You know, Captain, I've always wanted a
little more privacy. Perhaps under the circumstances, my own quarters. <br/>
JANEWAY: One step at a time, Doctor. <br/>
PARIS: You should have seen it when the parking enforcement officer
came over to the van. Tuvok tried to use pure Vulcan logic to talk her
out of giving us a citation. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Did it work? <br/>
PARIS: Of course not! <br/>
TUVOK: Given Mister Paris's alleged familiarity with twentieth century
America, it is a wonder we survived the experience at all. <br/>
