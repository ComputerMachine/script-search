We've been out here almost 5 hours and we haven't seen any sign of
those energy signatures. Isn't it time to admit they were nothing more
than galactic background noise? <br/>
PARIS: I want to keep looking a while longer, just to be sure. <br/>
TORRES: Ah! <br/>
PARIS: What's wrong? <br/>
TORRES: Cramp. Klingon bodies weren't meant to sit in a cockpit for
five hours at a stretch. <br/>
PARIS: You have a big dinner date or something? <br/>
TORRES: What's that supposed to mean? <br/>
PARIS: Well, you've been angling to get back to Voyager for about two
hours now. Just thought maybe there was a reason? Like Ensign Bristow. <br/>
TORRES: What? <br/>
PARIS: Oh, I've noticed he's been making any excuse to hang around
engineering. Around you. <br/>
TORRES: Freddie Bristow is a child. <br/>
PARIS: Oh, really. He looks like a grown up to me. Tall, good-looking
and I hear he plays a mean set of Pareses Squares. <br/>
TORRES: I played one game with him, and I whipped him. Look, he has a
crush on me. I can handle it. Why are you so interested? <br/>
PARIS: I'm just curious how someone with Klingon blood seems to live
the life of a tabern monk. <br/>
TORRES: Lieutenant, that is none of your business. <br/>
PARIS: Well, if you ever have a free evening, I have a holodeck
programme you might enjoy. Sailing on Lake Como? <br/>
TORRES: I'd rather take my chances with Freddie Bristow. Those energy
signatures are back. <br/>
PARIS: We must have crossed into a tachyon field. <br/>
TORRES: What's that? <br/>
PARIS: A ship has locked onto our hull. <br/>
TORRES: Why didn't we detect it? <br/>
PARIS: The tachyon field must have disrupted our sensors. I'm

EMH: Computer, pause playback. Excuse me but your entrance was early.
You're rushing the tempo. <br/>
DIVA: I am not rushing, you are lagging behind like a tired donkey. <br/>
EMH: I assure you I have studied the finest recordings of this opera.
Caruso and Galli-Curci, Pavarotti and Freni, Sural and T'Pena of
Vulcan. My tempo is accurate. <br/>
DIVA: Galli-Curci, Freni, T'Pena. They're all <i>fallite</i>,
mere dust balls. <i> Solo niente</i>, they are nothing.
Giuseppina Pantangeli, the greatest soprano living of the 22nd century
transcends them all, and conductors take their <i> tempi</i>
from me! <i>Capite</i>? <br/>

orchestral playback. <br/>
DIVA: Who allows you to make this choice? You are an amateur, you have
no sense of <i>rubato</i>, no <i>rallentando</i>.
It's like singing with a computer! <br/>
EMH: Madam, I may be an amateur, but I'm also known as a quick study,
and as I am in charge of this programme you will do it my way! Shall we
try it again. Computer, start playback. <i> O soave fanciulla</i>,
O... Stop playback. <br/>
DIVA: What now? <i> No e possibile</i>. <br/>
EMH: I couldn't remember the words. <br/>
DIVA: In all of my career I have never forgotten the lyrics. This is
the difference between amateur and <i>professionale</i>. <br/>
EMH: Just a momentary lapse, no need to over-react. <br/>

Their nervous system suffered trauma from some type of neuro-electric
weapon. It must have been extremely painful. <br/>
TORRES: It certainly was. <br/>
JANEWAY: Do you know why they attacked you? <br/>
TORRES: No idea. They seemed to be trying to communicate with us but we
couldn't understand them and then they just lifted their weapons. <br/>
EMH: The injuries are treatable. It shouldn't take long. <br/>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, send a message on all subspace bands. I want to find
out why my people were attacked. <br/>
TUVOK: Aye Captain. <br/>
JANEWAY: I'll ask Neelix if he knows anything about these people.
Doctor, keep me posted. <br/>
EMH: It would help if you didn't fidget so much. <br/>
TORRES: I'm really feeling better. Can't I get out of here? <br/>
EMH: When you're ready to leave I will tell you. <br/>
KES: Doctor, Tom doesn't seem to be responding to the treatment. <br/>
EMH: I'll look at him. Where's my retinal imager? <br/>
KES: I haven't seen it. <br/>
EMH: Did you move it from the instrument tray? <br/>
KES: I haven't been near the instrument tray. <br/>
EMH: I've just had the most unpleasant encounter with a mad woman on
the holodeck. She must have upset me more than I realised. Lieutenant,
you're perfectly all right. What are you still doing here? <br/>
TORRES: Thank you. <br/>
KES: I think he must have suffered some very deep tissue damage. The
regenerator isn't helping. Doctor? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
I've made numerous hails on wideband subspace. The only response has
been a single repeating message. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: What's that? <br/>
JANEWAY: I'd guess it's a language so unlike ours that the universal
translator can't interpret it. Harry, remodulate the translator, see if
we can decipher those sounds. Neelix, what can you tell us? <br/>
NEELIX: If these people are who I think they are, I can tell you this
is very bad news. I've never actually encountered them but from what
I've heard I'm glad I didn't. Most ships that enter their space are
never heard from again. Some have returned with everyone on board dead.
They're a complete mystery. No one knows their name, how many of them
there are, what the culture is like. Just that they really don't want
people violating their territory. <br/>
KIM: If this is any indication of their borders, it's a huge area of
space, hundreds of sectors. If we were to go around it it would take
months. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: I'd say over fifteen months even if we could sustain maximum
warp, which we can't. <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm not going to tell this crew we're adding another fifteen
months to this journey. We'll have to find another option. <br/>
TUVOK: If we are not to go around their space the only available option
is to go through it. <br/>
JANEWAY: Precisely. <br/>
KIM: Tom and B'Elanna hit a sensor net as they crossed the border. We
have to figure we'll run into it when we try to cross. But there are
ways around sensor nets. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: They can't possibly have enough ships to patrol a border this
size. We could probably find an unguarded section. <br/>
TUVOK: Would it affect your decision if I pointed out that encroaching
on the territory of an alien species is prohibited by starfleet
regulations? <br/>
JANEWAY: No, it wouldn't. <br/>
TUVOK: Captain, you have managed to surprise me. <br/>
JANEWAY: We're a long way from starfleet, Lieutenant. I'm not about to
waste 15 months because we've run into a bunch of bullies. <br/>
EMH [OC]: Sickbay to Captain Janeway. <br/>
JANEWAY: Go ahead, Doctor. <br/>
EMH [OC]: Please turn to your emergency medical holographic channel.
[on monitor] I'm afraid LieutenantParis suffered greater neurological
damage than my initial scan revealed. I'm going to have to perform a
motor cortex reconstruction. There's no need to be overly concerned.
His condition is not life-threatening. The procedure is a relatively
simple one for a skilled physician. <br/>
JANEWAY: Very good, Doctor. Keep me informed. All right, I want a plan
for crossing that border as quickly and as quietly as possible. We'll
reconvene in an hour. Dismissed. </font></p>

O soave fanciulla, o dolce viso di mite circonfuso alba lunar</i>.
<br/>
KES: Doctor, I have the cortical analeptics you asked for. <br/>
EMH: Good. Fill the hyposprays, we'll begin as soon as I've finished
scrubbing. <br/>
KES: Did I hear you singing? <br/>
EMH: Yes. 'O soave fanciulla'. It's an aria from La Boheme, a truly
exquisite opera by Giacomo Puccini, a human composer of the nineteenth
century. <br/>
KES: I didn't realise you enjoyed music. <br/>
EMH: I've recently begun a thorough study of opera. I find it quite
satisfying, but I am having difficulty finding a holographic partner
for the role of Mimi. All the <i> soprani</i> seem to have
the most irritating personalities. These women are arrogant, superior,
condescending. I can't imagine anyone behaving that way. <br/>
KES: What is it? <br/>
EMH: A quiz for you. What is the first step in this procedure? <br/>
KES: Establish the axon connections and then test for synaptic
potentials. <br/>
EMH: Ah, quite right. Very good. <br/>
KES: Doctor, what is it? <br/>
EMH: We seem to have a small problem. I can't remember how to perform
this operation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
All right. I've repaired the damaged pre-ganglionic fibres in the
spinal column. <br/>
KES: The final step is to restore the nerve sheath. You'll need the
myelin regenerator. <br/>
EMH: What is it? <br/>
KES: He's going into respiratory arrest! <br/>
EMH: What do I do? <br/>
KES: Apply an ethorin pulse to stabilise his motor neurons. <br/>
EMH: Apply a what? <br/>
KES: Vital signs are returning to normal. There, myelin regeneration is
complete. What's the synaptic potential reading? <br/>
EMH: Synaptic potentials are normal. Autonomic enzymatic systems are
functioning. <br/>
KES: Very good, Doctor, I think you've done it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
The EMH database seems to be experiencing a cascading overload of some
kind. Doc's memory circuits are deteriorating. <br/>
JANEWAY: We knew the Doctor was never designed to be up and running as
much as he has been, but I thought you programmed safety buffers so his
circuits wouldn't degrade? <br/>
TORRES: I did, and I installed them, but they're breaking down. <br/>
EMH: My self diagnostic routines have always indicated that in the
event of cascade failure I should simply be re-initialised. <br/>
TORRES: That would stop the cascade and allow us to reset your database
and personality sub-routines, but <br/>
KES: But what? <br/>
TORRES: It would restore the original programme. Reset him to the
person he was when we first activated him. <br/>
JANEWAY: In other words, he'd forget everything that's happened to him
over the past two years. <br/>
TORRES: Right. <br/>
JANEWAY: Doctor, how do you feel about that? <br/>
EMH: I can't say I'd like to lose the last two years, but my primary
responsibility is the health and welfare of this crew. In my current
state I am useless to them. I believe Lieutenant Torres should start
the re-initialisation process immediately. <br/>
KES: No, wait. Wait, please. We can't just treat the Doctor like he's a
computer any more. He's come too far for that. Doctor, please, think
about this. You'd be losing so much. Relationships you've developed,
our friendship, your sense of being a true member of his crew. All that
would be gone. <br/>
EMH: I can't put personal concerns over that of the crew. <br/>
KES: Look at the experiences you've had since you were activated.
You've made friends, learnt how to sing opera. You've even fallen in
love. If you lose those memories you won't be the same person. You said
you don't know what's causing his memory circuits to fail. <br/>
TORRES: Unfortunately no. <br/>
KES: So, if you re-initialise without finding out what's wrong the
problem could occur again. <br/>
TORRES: It's a possibility. <br/>
KES: Isn't it a better plan to look for the cause of the problem? If
B'Elanna can find it there may be a less radical solution. Tom Paris is
stable, he'll be back on duty today. There's no medical crisis at the
moment. I can certainly handle all the routine cases in sickbay.
Please, let's not just erase him without trying to help him first. <br/>
JANEWAY: If a crewmember came down with a debilitating illness you'd do
everything in your power to make them well again. I think we owe you
nothing less. <br/>
TORRES: I'll get started. <br/>
KES: Don't be discouraged. I know B'Elanna can find a way. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: Captain? I think we've found it. A way to get across the
border without being detected. <br/>
JANEWAY: Let's hear it. <br/>
KIM: Their sensor net uses a series of interlaced tachyon beams. If we
adjust our shields to refract those beams around the ship we can slip
across without appearing to have disrupted the net. <br/>
JANEWAY: Not bad. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: And we've found that this area shows no indication of their
vessels. We can slide through, go to high warp and be through this
narrow section of their territory in four days. <br/>

TORRES: All right. <br/>
EMH: Oh! That is extremely disconcerting. Please don't do it again! Now
what are you doing? <br/>
TORRES: Attenuating your forcefield projectors. Doctor, forgive me, but
this is very delicate work. Could you please sit over there for a few
minutes. <br/>
EMH: How extremely rude. May I remind you that I am, in a way, your
patient, who's suffering from an unknown and obviously debilitating
condition. I would think you'd be a little more sensitive to my needs. <br/>
TORRES: You are questioning my bedside manner? The good news is that
your projection system doesn't seem to be affected. However, I don't
know why your circuits are degrading. <br/>

EMH: It seems so long ago. <br/>

specifically created for the Emergency Medical system. <br/>
EMH: That's right. I should have remembered that. How could I have

TORRES: Yes. <br/>
EMH: I certainly hope you're going to be able to do something about
this annoying problem. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: What's wrong with it? <br/>
TORRES: He's experiencing a cascade failure. His memory circuits are
degrading. I was trying to bring the subroutines on line <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: If you don't mind, I can do it faster. <br/>
TORRES: I can see where you get your charming personality. <br/>
EMH: Not to mention my hairline. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: Here we are. A schematic of the EMH and it's component
sub-routines. <br/>
EMH: Can you determine the source of the problem? <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: This isn't good. The EMH has a level 4 memory fragmentation.
How long has the programme been active? <br/>
EMH: I have been active for, for <br/>
TORRES: Almost two years. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: Two years? Well there's your problem. This programme was
developed as a short term supplement to your medical staff, fifteen
hundred hours tops. <br/>
TORRES: I know. I added data compression buffers to compensate for the
additional time but they're breaking down. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: The EMH is a highly sophisticated programme. You shouldn't
go meddling in it's matrix when you don't know what you're doing. <br/>
TORRES: Should we shut down his programme then till we figure out how
to fix him? <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: At this point it doesn't matter. With a level four memory
fragmentation it'll simply continue to degrade. There's only one course
of action - a system-wide re-initialisation. Start over from scratch. <br/>
TORRES: We are aware of that option. Would it be possible to expand his
memory circuits instead? <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: Of course. Schedule it for your next maintenance layover at
McKinley Station. <br/>
TORRES: I'm afraid that is impossible. We're thousands of light years
from Federation space. <br/>
Zimmermann: Well, there's nothing more I can do. Either reinitialise it
or live with the knowledge that eventually this EMH will end up with
the intellectual capacity of a parsnip. <br/>

that we don't already know. What I need is to find out exactly why the
Doctor's memory circuits are degrading, so that we can come up with a
solution. Activate a level 4 diagnostic or whatever you need to do to

and learns and feels. It's made him a better physician. <br/>
EMH: An EMH programme can't feel anything. It's emotional reactions are
simply a series of algorithms designed to make it easier to interact
with. <br/>
KES: Oh he's much more than that, and I've known him for most of my
life. He's one of my closest friends. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: You can't possibly believe that this programme shares these
feelings. <br/>
KES: I know he does. <br/>

JANEWAY: What's the status of those ships, Mister Tuvok? <br/>
TUVOK: Still unpowered. They don't seem to have detected us. <br/>
JANEWAY: When I was in high school I snuck out of the house a couple of
times late at night. Had to tiptoe past my parents bedroom. That's kind
of how I feel right now. <br/>
PARIS: You sneaked out of your house? Where were you going? <br/>
JANEWAY: I'll have to leave that to your imagination, Lieutenant. <br/>
PARIS: Can I take a few guesses? <br/>
TUVOK: Captain, I'm detecting another ship, not part of the swarm. It
has been damaged, propulsion systems are not functional. <br/>
JANEWAY: Drop out of warp. Put it on screen. <br/>
PARIS: Looks like it's been pounded on for days. <br/>
JANEWAY: Any life signs? <br/>
KIM: I'm checking. Only one, and it's faint. <br/>
JANEWAY: Transporter room one, beam the survivor to sickbay. Harry,
start scanning that ship. See if you can figure out what happened to
it. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KES:
He's suffering from severe dehydration, damage to the spinal column.
There's evidence of trauma to the nervous system just like we found in
B'Elanna and Tom after they were attacked. <br/>
JANEWAY: Can I talk to him? <br/>
KES: You can try. I'll work on restoring his cranial nerves, but he's
so badly injured I'm not sure it'll help. <br/>
EMH: He's a sick man. This is where sick people come. <br/>
KES: Doctor, hold on to this tricorder, all right? Keep it pointed
right at the patient. <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm Kathryn Janeway, the Captain of this ship. Can you hear
me? <br/>
Chardis: Yes. <br/>
JANEWAY: Can you tell me what happened? Who attacked you? <br/>
Chardis: There were thousands of them, little ships, swarmed around my
freighter, covered every square metre of the hull. Then they began
extracting energy from all the ship's systems. We had no defence. Then
they boarded us. <br/>
JANEWAY: Did they use neuro-electric weapons? <br/>
Chardis: I don't know what they used. It was painful, people screaming,
dying. <br/>
JANEWAY: Had you provoked them in any way? <br/>
Chardis: We were in their space. That was enough. Captain, the rest of
my crew, is there anyone else? <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry, you're the only survivor. This woman is trying to
regenerate your motor neurons. <br/>
Chardis: We come from Mislan, five parsecs from here in a yellow dwarf
system. If you pass it will you tell our people? <br/>
JANEWAY: I'll make a point of it. <br/>
Chardis: It happened so quickly. <br/>
KES: His injuries were too severe. <br/>
EMH: He's a very sick man. <br/>
KES: Captain, the Doctor's getting worse. He doesn't even know who I am
any more. He has to be re-initialised. <br/>
JANEWAY: I agree, but I can't spare B'Elanna now. We have to get
through this space before we're attacked like his ship was. As soon as
it's possible I'll break her free. <br/>
KES: Is there anything at all I can do for him? <br/>
JANEWAY: The only thing I can think of is to keep his neural pathways
active. Ask him questions, keep him thinking, force him to use his
neural matrix. It might at least slow down the degradation. <br/>
KES: Doctor, you mustn't touch those. Here, this one's all right to
hold. <br/>
EMH: Shall I use it on the sick man? <br/>
KES: Yes, that's a good idea. </font></p>

KIM: I'm working on it. <br/>
JANEWAY: Let's see if they might be able to understand us. <br/>
TUVOK: Channel is open. <br/>
JANEWAY: This is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship
Voyager. We only want to proceed peacefully through this region of
space. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Do you think they're trying to communicate? <br/>
JANEWAY: Could be, but what they're trying to communicate is another
question. Any progress, Harry? <br/>
KIM: Getting a general idea, something like, too late, should have
listened. <br/>
JANEWAY: Report. <br/>
KIM: We've been hit with some sort kind of polaron burst. <br/>
TUVOK: The energy expenditure was not high enough to cause any damage.
It may not have been a weapon. <br/>
PARIS: Captain, that little ship is high-tailing it out of here. <br/>
JANEWAY: So it scanned us, sent out a polaron burst that caused no
damage and then took off. <br/>
KIM: Captain, the burst has changed the shield polarity. It's now
rotating at ninety two gigahertz. <br/>
JANEWAY: That means if anyone wanted to find us it's a lot easier now. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: I'll say. As far as anyone's sensors are concerned we're lit
up like a Christmas tree. <br/>
TUVOK: Captain, the swarm of ships has powered their engines and turned
toward us. They are in pursuit. <br/>

to outrun them. Bridge to Engineering. <br/>

EMH: Oh. Well, this isn't such a bad place. I remember there were a lot
of people here, wounded people. I asked some one to state the nature of
the medical emergency and then enquired as to the status of their Chief
Medical Officer. He was dead. And then everyone disappeared. <br/>
KES: I think that's when you were activated almost two years ago. <br/>
EMH: Oh surely not. That seems like last week. And there was a young
woman. I was rubbing her feet. She was trying to decide whether or not
to have a child. <br/>

TUVOK: The ships are now within range, Captain, but I do not detect any
indication that they are powering weapons. <br/>
JANEWAY: Do you have any idea what kind of weapon systems they use? <br/>

Zimmermann: I'm not sure what you expect me to do about it. <br/>
KES: I expect you to help. That's what you're programmed to do, isn't
it? <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: I have pointed out over and over, I am a diagnostic tool,
not an engineer. <br/>
KES: You have to try. You're the only one who can help now. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: Young woman, you don't seem to understand there are
limitations to my programming. I can't just decide to exceed them. <br/>
KES: The Doctor did so, why can't you? You'd better start trying
because I'm not leaving here until we accomplish something. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: It, he means a great deal to you, doesn't he? <br/>
KES: Yes he does, so start thinking about his memory circuits, his
holo-processors, his database, his matrix. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: Why are you looking at me like that? <br/>
KES: You told me you had the same matrix as the Doctor. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: An adaptive heuristic matrix, yes, in order to serve as a
diagnostic for all the EMH programs. <br/>
KES: Then couldn't your matrix be substituted for his? <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: I, I wouldn't have thought of that. <br/>
KES: But can it? <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: I'm not sure. But even if it were possible, the same
degradation would eventually occur to my matrix. <br/>
KES: What if yours were grafted onto his. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: Grafted? <br/>
KES: In medicine we sometimes graft portions of a healthy bone onto a
diseased one. It gives the bone solidity until it can heal. Can we do
something like that with your matrices? <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: Well, it would require a synchronous transfer of all the EMH
databases and subroutines. Not an easy process, mind you, but I suppose
we could try. <br/>
KES: Good. Let's get started. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: I must point out that you would no longer have a diagnostic
programme for the EMH. <br/>
KES: If we don't do this we won't have an EMH to diagnose. <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: Good point. You'll have to return to sickbay and transfer my
programme there. <br/>

Captain, our shield strength just went to zero. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: How did that happen? <br/>
KIM: Each one of those little ships is emitting an interferometric
pulse. They're modulating in opposition to our shield frequencies,
completely cancelling them out. <br/>
JANEWAY: All right, that's enough. Tuvok, give them a phaser sweep with
the forward array. Don't destroy any of them, just let them know we're
not going to sit here like ducks. <br/>
TUVOK: Aye Captain. <br/>
JANEWAY: What was that? <br/>
KIM: The interferometric pulses they're emitting. They've reflected the
energy of the phasers right back to us. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Anything we fire is going to affect us instead of them. What
about a photon torpedo? <br/>
TUVOK: Since our shield strength is non-existent, I would not recommend
it. <br/>
PARIS: They're only seven thousand kilometres away and still coming. <br/>

prepare the multitronic paths properly there's no chance of success. <br/>

EMH: What is? <br/>
ZIMMERMAN: Very well. We're as ready as we'll ever be. I've programmed
the computer to install my heuristic matrix onto the EMH primary
circuitry. We'll both have to be taken off line for the overlay to be
made. After the re-initialisation occurs you should activate the
Emergency Medical Hologram. <br/>
KES: I understand. <br/>

KIM: Captain, I've got a pattern on the interferometric pulses. It's a
lattice, connecting all the ships to each other. <br/>
JANEWAY: All right, here's what we're going to do. Turn those pulses
right back on them. Tuvok, lock phasers on their nearest ship. If we
can destroy one of them, there's every chance the interferometric pulse
that links them together will cause a chain reaction. <br/>
TUVOK: But the phaser fire will be reflected back toward us. <br/>
