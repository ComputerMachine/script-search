is pouring an orange drink.) <br/>
NEELIX: Anthraxic citrus peel, orange juice with just a hint of papalla
seed extract. An experimental blend. <br/>
TUVOK: The success rate of your culinary experiments has not been high.
<br/>
NEELIX: Ensign Golwat tried some yesterday, and she thought it was
delicious. In fact, she had a second glass, and she never has seconds. <br/>
TUVOK: Ensign Golwat is Bolian. Her tongue has a cartilaginous lining.
It would protect her against even the most corrosive acid. <br/>
NEELIX: All I ask is that you try it, Mister Vulcan. <br/>

sniffs and sips.) <br/>
TUVOK: Impressive. <br/>
NEELIX: Ah! I'll start squeezing that second glass. Breakfast is coming
right up. Porakan eggs. <br/>
TUVOK: Porakan? <br/>
NEELIX: The most flavourful eggs in the sector. Scrambled with a little
dill weed, a touch of rengazo, a galactic favourite. Now, these eggs
were not easy to prepare. After we picked them up on Porakas Four, I
had to sterilise them in a cryostatic chamber for three days. Then each
and every one had to be parboiled <br/>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, I would prefer not to hear the life history of my
breakfast. <br/>
NEELIX: On Talax it's a tradition to share the history of a meal before
you begin eating. It's a way of enhancing the culinary experience. My
mother was brilliant. She could make every course, every garnish come
alive by making it a character in a story. My favourite was the one
about the crustacean who <br/>
(Flames surge up around the egg pan, setting the contents alight.
Neelix quickly smothers it with a lid.) <br/>
TUVOK: What happened? <br/>
NEELIX: Er, some sort of power overload. I'm afraid it decimated your
breakfast. This is what my mother would call a tragic ending. <br/>
TUVOK: Engineering has been making adjustments to the plasma conduits
to accommodate a new energy source. It may have created a thermal surge
in the galley systems. <br/>
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Tuvok. Please report to the bridge. Mister
Neelix, I'd like you to join us as well. <br/>
NEELIX: Aye, Captain.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 50126.4. We have detected a
gaseous anomaly that contains sirillium, a highly combustible and
versatile energy source. We've altered course to investigate.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEELIX: Sirillium? <br/>
JANEWAY: Yes, and possibly large amounts of it. If so, we're going to
need to stockpile as much as we can. I'd like to convert storage bay
three into a containment chamber. <br/>
NEELIX: My pantry. <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry, Neelix. You're going to have to make other
arrangements. <br/>
NEELIX: Of course, Captain. You know, if I injected sirillium into my
thermal array, it might improve cooking time. <br/>
TORRES: Yes, and blow up half your kitchen in the process. Sirillium is
far more useful as a warp plasma catalyst. <br/>
TUVOK: The gas can also be used to boost deflector shield efficiency. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: The vultures are circling. <br/>
JANEWAY: Well, there's certainly no shortage of good ideas. Have all
department heads submit proposals for sirillium usage. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. <br/>
TUVOK: The anomaly is within visual range. <br/>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br/>
(This one is blue, not purple.) <br/>
JANEWAY: Analysis, Mister Kim. <br/>
KIM: It's a class seventeen nebula. I'm detecting standard amounts of
hydrogen, and helium, and seven thousand parts per million of
sirillium. <br/>
TORRES: Captain, I recommend we use the Bussard collectors to gather
the sirillium. They'll cut through that nebula like ice cream scoops. <br/>
PARIS: I'm picking up a lot of plasmatic turbulence in there. It might
be a bumpy ride. <br/>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, can you modify the shields to compensate? <br/>
(Tuvok's breath is shallow and his hands are twitching.) <br/>
JANEWAY: Tuvok. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Are you all right, Lieutenant? <br/>
TUVOK: I don't know. I'm experiencing dizziness and disorientation.
Permission to go to sickbay. <br/>

enters and collapses, eyes staring. Later, Janeway is present while the
EMH scans Tuvok.) <br/>
TUVOK: I was holding a young girl by the hand, tying to prevent her
from falling from a precipice. I was unable to keep my grip, and she
fell to her death. And there is more. I had an emotional response
anxiety, fear. An almost irrational anger at myself for letting her
fall. <br/>
KES: When did that happen? <br/>
TUVOK: It never happened. The girl was unfamiliar, and I've never been
in that situation. It was me as a child, and it did seem like a memory,
but I don't recall the incident. <br/>
EMH: Well, it was definitely a traumatic episode. Your heart rate
accelerated to three hundred beats per minute. Your adrenaline levels
rose by
one hundred thirteen percent and your neuroelectrical readings nearly
jumped off the scale. If you were human, I'd say you had a severe panic
attack. <br/>
TUVOK: I am not human. <br/>
EMH: No kidding. I don't know what happened to you, but there can be
any number of explanations. Hallucination, telepathic communication
from another race, repressed memory, momentary contact with a parallel
reality. Take your pick. The universe is such a strange place. <br/>
JANEWAY: I'll have Mister Kim examine the sensor logs. Maybe our
proximity to the nebula is affecting you somehow. <br/>
EMH: In the meantime, Lieutenant, you are free to go. All of your vital
signs have returned to normal, and I don't see any residual systemic
damage. But I want you to wear this neurocortical monitor. In case you
have another episode, it'll record a complete encephalographic profile
and alert sickbay at the same time. <br/>
(The EMH places the device behind Tuvok's left ear.) <br/>
TUVOK: A wise precaution, Doctor. Thank you.

(But the house of not-cards collapses, then the doorbell chimes.) <br/>
TUVOK: Enter. Kes. What is it? <br/>
KES: The doctor wanted me to adjust your neurocortical monitor to pick
up additional peptide readings. I can come back later if this is a bad
time. <br/>
TUVOK: No. You may proceed. <br/>
KES: What are you working on? <br/>
TUVOK: It is called a keethara. <br/>
KES: Keethara. What does that mean? <br/>
TUVOK: The approximate translation is structure of harmony. It is used
as a meditational aid. Building it requires precise balance and spatial
acuity. It helps to focus thought and refine mental control. <br/>
KES: At the moment, it doesn't look very harmonious. <br/>
TUVOK: No, it does not. <br/>
KES: I'm curious. What does a keethara look like when it's done? <br/>
TUVOK: The form is not predefined. It is a reflection of the builder's
state of mind. Thus, it is different each time. <br/>

perform, I'm concerned about you. <br/>
TUVOK: There is no need for concern. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Sorry I asked. <br/>
TUVOK: My apologies, Commander. I am distracted. I spent fourteen hours
last night in deep meditation, trying to determine the source of my
aberrant behaviour. I could not. <br/>

It is difficult to forget when you're wearing a neurocortical monitor

CHAKOTAY: Good point. Mister Kim? <br/>
KIM: I checked all the sensor logs. There's no sign of anything
emanating from the nebula that would have affected Tuvok or Voyager. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Anything unusual about the nebula itself? <br/>
KIM: No, it's a standard class seventeen. <br/>
TUVOK: I suggest we conduct a tachyon sweep of the nebula. It would
reveal the presence of any cloaked ships. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Cloaked ships? <br/>
TUVOK: Yes. We should be extremely cautious this close to Klingon
space. <br/>
TORRES: Tuvok, the Klingon Empire is on the other side of the galaxy. <br/>

</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EMH: I
think we may be dealing with a repressed memory. The memory engrams in
the dorsal region of the hippocampus are being disrupted. It's causing
physical damage to the surrounding tissue. In Vulcan medicine, this is
known as t'lokan schism. It means that the subject is inhibiting a
traumatic memory, which is beginning to resurface. <br/>
JANEWAY: And that's causing brain damage? <br/>
EMH: Strange, I know. In human subjects, repressed memories are nothing
more than psychological traumas which can be dealt with, with standard
therapeutic techniques. But in Vulcans, there is a physical reaction to
the battle between the conscious and the unconscious. In extreme cases,
the mind of the patient can literally lobotomise itself. <br/>
JANEWAY: What's the treatment? <br/>
EMH: There is no medical treatment for this condition. Vulcan
psychocognitive research suggests that the patient initiate a mind-meld
with a family member, and the two of them attempt to bring the
repressed memory into the conscious mind. <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm the closest thing Tuvok has to a family member on this
ship. <br/>
EMH: That's why I've asked you to come. He has a request to make of
you. <br/>
(Tuvok is on a biobed, meditating.) <br/>
TUVOK: Did the doctor explain the situation to you? <br/>
JANEWAY: Yes. Tuvok, are you sure it's the right thing to do? <br/>
TUVOK: I don't know how else to proceed. The doctor tells me that this
is a memory. And yet, no matter how hard I try, I cannot remember. If
the doctor is correct, if this is an experience I pushed into my
unconscious mind, it could be very dangerous to me, even
life-threatening. I realise it's asking a great deal of you, Captain,
and I did consider turning to one of the Vulcans on the ship, but this
meld would be more intimate than most. A family member is normally
chosen because of the implicit trust that usually exists. On this ship,
I trust you more than anyone else. <br/>
JANEWAY: Whatever happens, I'll be there for you, Tuvok. I'll help you
get through this. <br/>
TUVOK: I will initiate the meld and attempt to access the memory
fragment. Once that has been accomplished, you will act as my pyllora. <br/>
JANEWAY: Your pyllora? <br/>
TUVOK: My guide, my counsellor. You will help me reconstruct the memory
in its entirety. And as I am reliving it, you will help me to objectify
the experience. By processing the experience, rather than repressing
it, I can begin to overcome my fear, anger and the other emotional
responses, and to reintegrate the memory into my conscious mind. <br/>
JANEWAY: When I'm in your memory, will I actually be reliving it with
you? <br/>
TUVOK: No. I will be the only one who notices your presence. You will
be an observer in the memory, but not a participant. This will give you
the freedom to guide me objectively. <br/>
JANEWAY: When do we start? <br/>
TUVOK: I will need time to prepare. Please return in one hour. <br/>
(One hour later, Tuvok and Janeway are sitting opposite each other in
chairs, in the surgery bay. Janeway is also wearing a monitor.) <br/>
EMH: We're ready when you are, Captain. <br/>
TUVOK: Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts. I am taking
us back, back to the boy that I was, the boy lying on the precipice.

thought your first assignment was aboard the Wyoming. <br/>
TUVOK: It's a long story, Captain, but suffice it to say, this was my
first Starfleet career. I was twenty nine years old. <br/>
JANEWAY: So what's happening? Are we about to encounter the Klingons? <br/>
TUVOK: Not exactly. The Klingon moon Praxis is about to explode. <br/>
JANEWAY: Praxis. <br/>
TUVOK: During this period, it was a primary source of energy for the
Klingon Homeworld. <br/>
JANEWAY: Praxis. Yes. Its destruction would have lasting repercussions
throughout the quadrant, and it led to the first Federation-Klingon
peace treaty. <br/>

JANEWAY: So what happened? Did you go to Praxis? <br/>
TUVOK: No. We were warned off by the Klingons, and resumed our survey
mission. However, two days later, we learned that two Starfleet
officers were accused of murdering the Klingon Chancellor. They were
brought back to the Klingon Homeworld to stand trial. Captain Sulu had
served under both officers for many years, and he felt an intense
loyalty to them. <br/>
SULU: Helm, set a course for Kronos, maximum warp. Take us through the
Azure Nebula. That should conceal our approach. <br/>
HELMSMAN: Aye, sir. <br/>
JANEWAY: I don't get it. What's going on? <br/>
TUVOK: He is about to attempt a rescue of Captain Kirk and Doctor
McCoy. As you can see, everyone seemed perfectly willing to go along
with this breach of orders. However, I felt differently. <br/>
TUVOK: Captain, am I correct in assuming that you have decided to
embark on a rescue mission? <br/>
SULU: That's right. Do you have a problem with that, Ensign? <br/>
TUVOK: I do. It is a direct violation of our orders from Starfleet
Command, and it could precipitate an armed conflict between the Klingon
Empire and the Federation. <br/>
SULU: Objection noted. Resume your station. <br/>
TUVOK: Sir, as a Starfleet officer, it is my duty to formally protest. <br/>
RAND: Tuvok! <br/>
SULU: A pretty bold statement for an Ensign with only two months space
duty under his belt. <br/>
TUVOK: I am aware of my limited experience, but I am also very much
aware of Starfleet regulations and my obligation to carry them out. <br/>
RAND: That's enough. Ensign, you're relieved. I'm sorry about this,
Captain. I assure you it will not happen again. <br/>
SULU: Ensign, you're absolutely right. But you're also absolutely
wrong. You'll find that more happens on the bridge of a starship than
just carrying out orders and observing regulations. There is a sense of
loyalty to the men and women you serve with. A sense of family. Those
two men on trial, I served with them for a long time. I owe them my
life a dozen times over, and right now they're in trouble, and I'm
going to help them. Let the regulations be damned. <br/>
TUVOK: Sir, that is a most illogical line of reasoning. <br/>

collapse, resulting in brain death. <br/>
JANEWAY: We were just starting to make some progress. We finally
accessed the repressed memory. I saw Tuvok as a boy. And the girl on
the precipice. Can I talk to him? <br/>

sedated for the next few hours. I'll let you know when it's safe to

is studying Starfleet records from 9521.6 when the doorbell chimes.) <br/>
JANEWAY: Come in. Ah, Ensign. What have you found? <br/>
KIM: I don't see any connection between this nebula and the one the
Excelsior saw eighty years ago. This one's a class seventeen, while
theirs was an eleven. Both contain trace amounts of sirillium, but
that's about all. <br/>
JANEWAY: But they do look similar. <br/>
KIM: To the naked eye, but not to sensors. Technically, they're very
different. You know, I've been talking to the doctor, and he tells me
it's not unusual for a repressed memory to resurface because of a smell
or a visual detail. Maybe the visual similarities between the two
nebulas simply triggered Tuvok's memory of the Excelsior. <br/>
JANEWAY: Well, what about the memory of the little girl? What does she
have to do with Tuvok's experiences on board Sulu's ship? The Excelsior
seems so far removed from that childhood incident. <br/>
KIM: Who knows that goes on in a Vulcan's mind. Maybe there is no
connection. And going back to the memory of the Excelsior was just an
accident, a stray thought Tuvok was having because of the similarities
between the two nebulas. <br/>
JANEWAY: You may be right. Nevertheless, I've been studying the
Excelsior logs. <br/>
KIM: What do they say? <br/>
JANEWAY: Unfortunately, they don't say anything at all. <br/>
KIM: Nothing? <br/>
JANEWAY: It would seem that Captain Sulu decided not to enter that
journey into his official log. The day's entry makes some cryptic
remark about the ship being damaged in a gaseous anomaly and needing
repairs, but nothing else. <br/>
KIM: You mean he falsified his logs? <br/>
JANEWAY: It was a very different time, Mister Kim. Captain Sulu,
Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy. They all belonged to a different breed of
Starfleet officer. Imagine the era they lived in. The Alpha Quadrant
still largely unexplored. Humanity on verge of war with Klingons.
Romulans hiding behind every nebula. Even the technology we take for
granted was still in its early stages. No plasma weapons, no
multiphasic shields. Their ships were half as fast. <br/>
KIM: No replicators, no holodecks. You know, ever since I took
Starfleet history at the academy, I always wondered what it would be
like to live in those days. <br/>
JANEWAY: Space must have seemed a whole lot bigger back then. It's not
surprising they had to bend the rules a little. They were a little
slower to invoke the Prime Directive, and a little quicker to pull
their phasers. Of course, the whole bunch of them would be booted out
of Starfleet today. But I have to admit, I would have loved to ride
shotgun at least once with a group of officers like that. <br/>

VALTANE: Me neither. I can't believe we're going to do this. I didn't

him on the bridge. <br/>
VALTANE: Oh, come on, Tuvok. Isn't it more fun than charting gaseous

TUVOK: The human fascination with fun has led to many tragedies in your
short, but violent, history. One wonders how your race has survived
having so much fun. <br/>
VALTANE: Vulcans. You guys need to relax. <br/>
TUVOK: No, I will not relax. Ever since I entered the Academy, I've had
to endure the egocentric nature of humanity. You believe that everyone
in the galaxy should be like you, that we should all share your sense
of humour and your human values. <br/>
VALTANE: Well, if you hated it here so much, why'd you join Starfleet
in the first place? <br/>
TUVOK: I joined under pressure from my parents. But I've already
decided to resign my commission once this assignment is complete. <br/>
VALTANE: Well, your loss. <br/>
(Valtane rolls over to sleep.) <br/>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, did you really mean that? <br/>
TUVOK: At this point in my life, yes. My experiences at the Academy and
on board the Excelsior were not pleasant. <br/>
JANEWAY: I knew you left Starfleet for over fifty years, but I never
knew why. I didn't realise it was because of a conflict with humans. <br/>
TUVOK: My perceptions of humanity and Starfleet were undoubtedly
coloured by the fact that I did not want to be here in the first place.
<br/>
JANEWAY: Your parents really forced you to go to the Academy? <br/>
TUVOK: It was their wish, and I felt an obligation to fulfill it. <br/>
JANEWAY: What did you do during those fifty years? <br/>
TUVOK: I returned to Vulcan, where I spent several years in seclusion,
immersing myself in the Kolinahr, a rigorous discipline intended to
purge all emotions. I wanted to attain a state of pure and total logic.
<br/>
JANEWAY: What happened? <br/>
TUVOK: Unfortunately, six years into my studies, I began the Pon farr.
I took a mate. <br/>
JANEWAY: T'Pel. <br/>
TUVOK: Yes. We decided to raise a family together, so I chose to
postpone my studies. <br/>
JANEWAY: And what brought you back to Starfleet? <br/>
TUVOK: Raising children of my own made me appreciate what my parents
experienced raising me. And I came to realise that the decisions I made
as a young man were not always in my best interest. I understood their
decision to send me to the Academy, and that there were many things I
could learn from humans and other species, so I decided to expand my
knowledge of the galaxy. Starfleet provided that opportunity. <br/>
JANEWAY: Well, I'm glad you had a change of heart. <br/>
TUVOK: As am I, Captain. Although, heart had very little to do with it.
It was a logical decision. <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm sure it was. <br/>

moment, they were firing concussive charges across our bow.

SULU: Sirillium? That's a highly combustible substance, isn't it? <br/>
TUVOK: Affirmative. <br/>
SULU: Is there any way we could ignite the sirillium? <br/>
TUVOK: If we modulated a positron beam to a subspace frequency, it
would trigger a thermochemical reaction in the sirillium. <br/>
SULU: Like tossing a match into a pool of gasoline. Would their shields
withstand the blast? <br/>
TUVOK: Yes, but their sensors and tactical systems would be disrupted
for several seconds. <br/>

EMH: Creating a false memory so traumatic that the mind would repress
it. And that's where it would live in person after person, hiding in a

those days on the Excelsior. <br/>
TUVOK: On the contrary. I do not experience feelings of nostalgia. But
there are times when I think back to those days of meeting Kirk, Spock
and the others, and I am pleased that I was part of it. <br/>
JANEWAY: In a funny way, I feel like I was a part of it too. <br/>
TUVOK: Then perhaps you can be nostalgic for both of us. </font>
