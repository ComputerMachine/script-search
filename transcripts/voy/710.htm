Good morning. <br/>

Here you are, Lieutenant.  <br/>(Torres takes the PADD.)<br/>

TORRES: I don't remember giving you permission to work here. <br/>
ICHEB: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. <br/>
SEVEN: I'm helping him study warp mechanics. <br/>
TORRES: You should have notified me. It's a busy day, and I. <br/>(Torres stumbles against Seven.) <br/>
SEVEN: Lieutenant? <br/>
TORRES: I'm fine. <br/>(Seven helps her sit down. Icheb scans her.)<br/>
ICHEB: I'm detecting another lifesign. <br/>
SEVEN: Where? <br/>
ICHEB: Inside Lieutenant Torres. It could be a parasite. <br/>(Seven checks his tricorder readings.)<br/>
SEVEN: Seven of Nine to the Doctor. <br/>
EMH [OC]: Go ahead. <br/>
SEVEN: I'll be accompanying Lieutenant Torres to Sickbay. <br/>
EMH: What's wrong? <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: The
foetus appears to be about seven weeks old and doing quite well. So are
you. <br/>
PARIS: Why did she faint? <br/>
EMH: Klingon and human metabolisms sometimes clash. <br/>
TORRES: Tell me about it. <br/>
EMH: It's not uncommon for such pregnancies to cause biochemical
fluctuations in the mother. <br/>
PARIS: Is that serious? <br/>
EMH: Not usually. You can expect some behavioural volatility, increased
nutritional needs. Creating new life is a big job. <br/>
PARIS: Creating new life. <br/>
TORRES: I can't believe it. <br/>
EMH: I don't mean to be indelicate but, weren't you trying to get
pregnant? <br/>
TORRES: Well, of course. I mean, we knew we wanted a family. <br/>
PARIS: But the odds against human-Klingon conception are so high. <br/>
EMH: Well, apparently you've beaten the odds. May I be the first to
congratulate you. <br/>
PARIS: When is the baby due? <br/>
EMH: Normally, Klingon pregnancies run thirty weeks. But with mixed
species, it could be sooner. <br/>
PARIS: Is it a girl or a boy? <br/>
TORRES: No. Don't tell. I want to be surprised. <br/>
PARIS: We've already been surprised. <br/>
TORRES: I just don't see any reason to have to label the baby. I don't
want to know the gender. I don't want to have to pick a name yet. <br/>

PARIS: Maybe I could replicate one of those antique cribs. <br/>

JANEWAY: Adjust. This is a big change. <br/>

it's time. <br/>

Congratulations, buddy. <br/>

KIM: Actually, I think it was a transmission from the Borg. It's all
over now. No more late nights on the holodeck. No more racing the Delta
Flyer. <br/>
PARIS: Don't you think you're exaggerating just a little? <br/>
KIM: I've seen it happen. The new dad gets tied down with family. Old
friends drop away. <br/>
PARIS: It's fatherhood , Harry, not exile. <br/>
KIM: If you say so. Kidding aside, how's it feel? <br/>

other a long time. We ought to work more closely. <br/>
TUVOK: I'll keep that in mind. <br/>
PARIS: So, I guess you've heard. B'Elanna and I are going to have a baby.

PARIS: Finally, someone who doesn't know. <br/>
TUVOK: Allow me to extend my best wishes. <br/>
PARIS: Thanks. You know, a baby is, er, it's a big responsibility. But
I'm ready for it. Not that you can ever be completely ready, can you? <br/>
TUVOK: Lieutenant, are you asking me for advice about fatherhood? <br/>
PARIS: Well, I don't know anyone else who's been through it. <br/>
TUVOK: I'm afraid my parenting skills are somewhat dormant. It's been
many years since my children were young. <br/>
PARIS: Then you've had a long time to think back on it. Any helpful
hints? <br/>
TUVOK: Offspring can be disturbingly illogical, yet profoundly
fulfilling. You should anticipate paradox. <br/>

So? <br/>
TORRES: Looks nice. <br/>
PARIS: Well, I figured quiet romantic dinners may soon be a thing of
the past. Tough day? <br/>
TORRES: The captain practically relieved me of duty, as if I couldn't
handle being an engineer and being pregnant at the same time. <br/>
PARIS: Well, if you ever need a baby-sitter, Godfather Neelix is ready
to go. <br/>
TORRES: Chakotay wants to be godfather. <br/>
PARIS: Neelix already has a list of names. <br/>
TORRES: Oh, I don't mind people suggesting names. What annoys me is all
of the free advice about feeding, discipline. <br/>
PARIS: Folk wisdom is my favourite. According to Chell, Bolians believe
that if you give birth near a warp core, it'll improve the baby's
disposition. <br/>
TORRES: Why does everybody feel they're entitled to give us advice?
This is our child. <br/>
PARIS: People should know better than to interfere with a Klingon
mother. <br/>
TORRES: What's that supposed to mean? <br/>
PARIS: Nothing. It was a joke. <br/>
TORRES: What does being Klingon have to do with it? <br/>
PARIS: Take it easy. <br/>
TORRES: I don't want to take it easy! I want everybody to back off and
just let me. (pause) The Doctor said I might experience some behavioural
volatility. I guess this is it. <br/>
PARIS: Forget about the Doctor. Forget the captain or the
godfathers. <br/>
TORRES: Maybe you're right. <br/>

doubts. None of this belongs to them. <br/>

It's a holographic extrapolation of your child's spine, approximately
ten months after birth. <br/>
TORRES: It's deviated. <br/>
EMH: Yes, there's a pronounced curvature to the left. <br/>
PARIS: Can it be corrected? <br/>
TORRES: I had surgery for it when I was a baby. <br/>
PARIS: You never told me that. <br/>
TORRES: My mother had it, too. <br/>
EMH: It tends to run in Klingon families, especially among females. <br/>
PARIS: Are you saying that this baby is a girl? <br/>
EMH: No. I didn't say that. <br/>
PARIS: But it is a girl, right? <br/>
EMH: You cannot infer that. <br/>
TORRES: It's okay. You might as well just tell us. <br/>
EMH: Yes. It's a girl. And aside from the deviated spine, she's healthy.
<br/>
PARIS: Will she need surgery? <br/>
EMH: Fortunately, we've advanced beyond that. Genetic modification is
the treatment of choice. <br/>
PARIS: If you can project an image of the spine, can you use the
genetic data to show us the whole baby? <br/>
EMH: I could. It would only be an approximation. <br/>

TORRES: My daughter is not going to be a Klingon warrior. <br/>
EMH: With all due respect, you have no idea what your daughter's going

used to fall asleep in class all the time, so instead of John Torres,
they called me John Snore-ez. <br/>

gotten moody, unpredictable, argumentative. Just like her mother. <br/>(B'Elanna is listening.)<br/>

JOHN: Everything's become a fight with her. I guess the older, I get the
less intensity I can handle. You know, it's funny how Mom and Dad
always turn out to be right. <br/>

JOHN: Mom warned me not to marry Miral. <br/>

live with a Klingon. And now I'm living with two of them.

think of my proposal. <br/>
EMH: Actually, I've changed my opinion. <br/>

PARIS: On what grounds? <br/>
EMH: The clash I mentioned between Klingon and human metabolism? It's
more extensive than I realised. <br/>
TORRES: How extensive? <br/>
EMH: Theoretically, it could lead to complete metabolic failure. <br/>
TORRES: But you can fix it. <br/>
EMH: By eliminating most of her Klingon genetic material. <br/>

EMH: My analysis was quite thorough. Of course if our circumstances
were different, you would be free to seek a second opinion. <br/>

on. <br/>

be unwise to delay this too long. <br/>
