as a Klingon warrior, is fighting other warriors.)<br/>
JANEWAY: P'tahk! Prepare to meet your ancestors! <br/>
(But the other warriors keep pushing her back until one manages to
thrust the point of his bat'leth into her chest, knocking her down on
her back.)<br/>
JANEWAY: This battle is yours today,
but the House of Mo'kai will never yield. <br/>
(She grabs a mace from a fallen Klingon and resumes the fight. She is
interrupted by an Hirogen in Klingon armour.)<br/>
KARR: Doh-cha scree! Move away, coward. I want to make this kill. <br/>
JANEWAY: You should have killed me when my back was turned. <br/>
KARR: I want to see the fear in your eyes. <br/>
JANEWAY: Look closely and you'll see your own destruction. <br/>
KARR: You are resilient prey. <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm no one's prey. <br/>
(She raises the mace and he stabs her in the stomach.) <br/>
KARR: You are mine, now and after death. Sickbay, this is Holodeck
two. Janeway requires medical assistance. </font></p>

is surrounded by Hirogen vessels. Janeway now looks human on the
biobed. An Hirogen is working in Sickbay.)<br/>
MEDIC: She'll survive. <br/>
KARR: What about her neural interface? <br/>
(The medic scans a Y shaped scar below Janeway's jawline.)<br/>
MEDIC: Stable. <br/>
KARR: Are you sure? There were times when she seemed aware of who she
is. <br/>
MEDIC: Impossible. I was monitoring the crew during the entire
simulation. She believes she's whoever we programme her to be. Shall I
return her
to the Klingon simulation? <br/>
KARR: No. Bring her to Holodeck one. I've found another programme I
want to try. A conflict that took place on her own planet. It should
prove stimulating. </font></p>

French café during World War 2. Mademoiselle de Neuf is singing It
Can't Be Wrong to piano accompaniment.)<br/>
SEVEN:
Wrong, would it be wrong to kiss? Seeing I feel like this, would it be
wrong to try? Wrong, would it be wrong to stay, here in your arms this
way, under this starry sky? If it is wrong (Tuvok is the bartender in a
white jacket, and the owner wears a white three piece man's suit à la
Marlene Dietrich as she greets her Nazi and French customers. She moves
amongst the tables.)<br/>
JANEWAY: Welcome to Le Coeur de Lion. I'm Katrine. The first round is
with my compliments, on one condition. You leave the war outside. More
escargot for table nine. Jacques, no lady tonight? Oh, we'll have to
see
what we can do about that. <br/>
(She sits at a table.)<br/>
JANEWAY: Forgive my neglecting you. Now, where were
we? Ah, yes, my latest adventure in Paris. <br/>
(She looks over to the bar and sees Tuvok nod towards the entrance. Two
Hirogen Nazi officers are entering.)<br/>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid I'll have to neglect
you again. Excuse me. <br/>
(She goes to the bar.)<br/>
TUVOK: That's him. <br/>
JANEWAY: Our new Kommandant? <br/>
TUVOK: British intelligence believes he's been sent here to oversee the
occupation of the city. <br/>
JANEWAY: What's his history? <br/>
TUVOK: He served with Rommel in North Africa and Schmidt in Poland. He
is a formidable military strategist, notorious for his cruelty. <br/>
JANEWAY: Ah. Let's make him feel at home. Send him a bottle of Chateau
LaTour. My compliments. <br/>
TUVOK: The '29? <br/>
JANEWAY: I hate to waste good wine. Give him the '36. <br/>
TUVOK: As you wish. <br/>
SEVEN: And I have waited so long. It must be right. It can't be
wrong. <br/>
(The song finishes, and she gets a round of applause.)<br/>
SEVEN: Merci. Be generous to Claude this evening. Without him, my voice
is empty. Good evening. <br/>TURANJ: Sing. <br/>
SEVEN: Tonight's performance is over. Return tomorrow. <br/>
TURANJ: Now. <br/>
SEVEN: Remove your hand. <br/>
TURANJ: Obey me, or I will hunt you down and your bones
will adorn the bulkhead of my ship. <br/>
KARR: Sit down and play the game. In this setting, we have no ships.
We are an ancient race of soldiers intent upon conquering this world.
Play the game. <br/>
JANEWAY: Now, now, what's this? Mademoiselle LeNeuf will be happy to
sing another song. Just give her a few minutes to freshen up. <br/>
SEVEN: It's late. <br/>
JANEWAY: Freshen up. <br/>
SEVEN: Very well. <br/>
JANEWAY: Kommandant Karr. <br/>
KARR: You know me. <br/>
JANEWAY: Your reputation precedes you. I'm Katrine. Le Coeur de Lion is
my establishment. The first round is with my compliments, on one
condition. You leave the war outside. <br/>
KARR: I wish to speak with her. Alone. <br/>
(The nearby French patrons and the SS officer leave them.)<br/>
JANEWAY: Charming gentleman. <br/>
KARR: He is disoriented. Your world is unfamiliar to him. <br/>
JANEWAY: He'll be comfortable soon enough. The arms of France are open
to all. <br/>
KARR: I've heard otherwise. <br/>
(They sit at a table.)<br/>
JANEWAY: What do you mean? <br/>
KARR: I understand there is opposition to our presence here among
your citizens. <br/>
JANEWAY: The Resistance? In Paris perhaps. But this is a small city,
defenceless. We've learned to be a little more diplomatic. When this
war is over we want to remain on good terms with the victor. <br/>
KARR: Whoever that may be. <br/>
JANEWAY: Whoever that may be. <br/>
(A waiter brings the wine and glasses.)<br/>
KARR: Your city may be defenceless, but it's crucial to the war. Any
ground assault into Germany must pass through this province. The
Resistance will come here. <br/>
JANEWAY: If they do, I'll tell them what I tell everyone. Leave the war
outside. <br/>
(The Hirogen Alpha tries the wine.)<br/>
KARR: Excellent. <br/>(An Hirogen SS officer comes to the table.)<br/>
TURANJ: Kommandant, I've been informed there's a problem in
the Engineering section. The warp plasma network has become unstable. <br/>
JANEWAY: What's he talking about? <br/>
KARR: It need not concern you. To the hunt. <br/>
JANEWAY: The hunt? <br/>
KARR: For the Resistance. I shall take great pleasure in tracking them
down and making the kill. <br/>
(He kisses her hand and leaves.)<br/>
JANEWAY: Au revoir. <br/>
(Later, Seven is counting the takings.)<br/>
JANEWAY: How'd we do? <br/>
SEVEN: Insufficient for a Saturday night. Twelve hundred forty seven
francs and eighty one Reichmarks. <br/>
JANEWAY: Well, it should be enough to buy an oscillator to extend the
range of our radio. First thing tomorrow morning I want you to take a
little trip to the countryside. There's a Monsieur Groleau who has a
cottage just past the third bridge. He's got a wine cellar full of
vacuum tubes. Tell him we need a high frequency oscillator. Offer him
three hundred francs but don't go any higher than five hundred. <br/>
SEVEN: We have more pressing needs. <br/>
JANEWAY: Such as? <br/>
SEVEN: Explosives. We need a launcher that can fire armour piercing
grenades. <br/>
JANEWAY: Planning on blowing up a German tank? <br/>
SEVEN: If necessary. <br/>
JANEWAY: We're not trying to build an army here. <br/>
SEVEN: Then maybe it's time we did. Three more German battalions have
occupied the city and a Panzer division is holding position eleven
kilometres away. When the Americans arrive and the fighting begins, I
don't intend to be standing next to a piano singing Moonlight Becomes
You. <br/>
JANEWAY: The Americans won't even be able to approach this city without
our help. And if they can't liberate Sainte Claire the assault into
Germany could fail. We need to be gathering information about German
troop movements and relaying it to Allied Command. <br/>
SEVEN: I'm tired of lighting the Nazi's cigarettes and laughing at
their jokes. We should be helping the Allies by assassinating these
pigs. <br/>
JANEWAY: The moment we start shooting we expose ourselves. Right now,
no one suspects us. And I am not about to risk our entire operation
because you've suddenly developed a nervous trigger finger. <br/>
SEVEN: That is your opinion, Madame. <br/>
JANEWAY: I'm the leader of the movement here and right now my opinion
is the only one that counts, so get the oscillator. I think we're all
feeling the strain. It's been a hard four years. But believe me, the
Third Reich is feeling it too. We just have to hang on a little while
longer. Word from the Americans is going to come any day. <br/>
SEVEN: Perhaps. <br/>
(Seven leaves.)<br/>
TUVOK: Again? <br/>
JANEWAY: Again. Why is she so adamant? What she's proposing would put
us all at risk. <br/>
TUVOK: Maybe that's her intention. <br/>
JANEWAY: If you have suspicions, my old friend, let's hear them. <br/>
TUVOK: From the beginning, she's been argumentative, and on more than a
few occasions she's disobeyed your direct orders. <br/>
JANEWAY: She's headstrong. Typical of the underground. <br/>
TUVOK: Nevertheless, her behaviour has threatened our identities. <br/>
JANEWAY: She's the only munitions expert we have, and she can carry a
tune. We need her. Let's keep our eye on her. Have her followed for the
next few days. If she is a Nazi infiltrator, we'll have to eliminate
her. </font></p>

increasing their patrols. <br/>
TUVOK: Perhaps it's time we chose another courier. Our baker is
arousing suspicion. <br/>
NEELIX: There's no need to worry. I change my route every day, and I've
become quite friendly with most of the Gestapo. They just love my

Quart de Chaume.)<br/>

decryption sequence. A, H, C. Straight from Allied High Command. <br/>
NEELIX: It must be important. <br/>
TUVOK: All messages regarding the war are important. It's only a matter
of degree. <br/>
NEELIX: I suppose you're right, but do you have to be so logical about
everything? <br/>
TUVOK: In any covert battle, logic is a potent weapon. You might try it
sometime. <br/>

there and plant a bomb. <br/>

JANEWAY: How? <br/>
TORRES: I'm upset. I need to see my special friend. Even if it means
bothering him at the office. <br/>
TUVOK: A reconnaissance mission. <br/>
TORRES: I'll try to locate the radio, see where the guards are posted,
examine the locks. Gather enough information to get us inside. <br/>

his own child. <br/>

KAPITAN: Sir? <br/>
KARR: We entered this city with superior firepower against a weakened
prey. Do you really deserve these prizes? <br/>

NAZI: Sir, you question our destiny? <br/>
KARR: Of course not. But I want to hear it in your own words. Tell me,
why are we the Master Race? <br/>

land for a thousand years before the degenerate races brought their
corruption. Europe must be purified. <br/>

More cunning? <br/>
KAPITAN: Yes, of course. <br/>

continue the hunt? If your prey were armed instead of defenceless, what
then? <br/>

lacerations. The last crewmember you treated was brought back in with
internal bleeding. <br/>
MEDIC: Your crew is fragile. They fall too easily. <br/>

for
this kind of punishment. <br/>

KARR: What happened? <br/>
MEDIC: These prey were hunted by Turanj. Their injuries are
severe. <br/>
EMH: You assured me that your people would avoid causing serious head
injuries. Another centimetre and the bullet would have penetrated her
brain. If you can't keep your people under control, then you should put
an end to this blood sport. <br/>

one hunt you will never see. You nearly destroyed two of my favourite
prey. You were careless. <br/>
TURANJ: I've become impatient. We penetrated this vessel,
overcame their defences, and in the moment of the kill, you forced us
to stop. Now we play these incessant games. It's time we took our
trophies and moved on. <br/>
KARR: Your lust for the kill has blinded you, like many young hunters.
If you took the time to study your prey, to understand its behaviour,
you might learn something. <br/>
TURANJ: There is nothing to be learned. <br/>
KARR: You're wrong. Each prey exposes us to another way of life and
makes us re-evaluate our own. Have you considered our future? What
would become of us when we have hunted this territory to exhaustion? <br/>
TURANJ: We will travel to another part of space, search for
new prey, as we have always done. <br/>
KARR: A way of life that hasn't changed for a thousand years. <br/>
TURANJ: Why should it? <br/>
KARR: Species that don't change, die. We've lost our way. We've
allowed our predatory instincts to dominate us. We disperse ourselves
throughout the quadrant, sending ships in all directions. We've become
a solitary race, isolated. We've spread ourselves too thin. We're no
longer a culture. We have no identity. In another thousand years, no
one
will remember the name Hirogen. Our people must come back together,
combine forces, rebuild our civilisation. <br/>
TURANJ: What of the hunt? <br/>
KARR: The Hunt will always continue, but in a new way. I intend to
transform this ship into a vast simulation, populated with a varied and
endless supply of prey. In time, this technology can be duplicated for
other Hirogen. These holodecks will allow us to hold onto our past,
while we face the future. <br/>
TURANJ: Even if I were persuaded, others wouldn't be. <br/>
KARR: Then you are with me? I must continue my research. I'll see you
tomorrow on holodeck one. The Americans are due to invade. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The EMH
wakes Seven and whispers in her ear.)<br/>
EMH:
Remain calm and stay quiet. There's a Hirogen working in the bio-lab.
He might hear us. What's the last thing you remember? <br/>
SEVEN: An attack. Hirogen vessels. They breached our hull and boarded
the ship. I was in a phaser fight on deck three. I was struck several
times. That's all I remember. <br/>
EMH: Then you have no memory of the simulations in the holodeck? <br/>
SEVEN: None. <br/>
EMH: The neural interface must be circumventing your memory centres. <br/>
SEVEN: Neural interface? <br/>
EMH: It's a subdermal transmitter that links your neocortex to the
holodeck. In essence, it makes you believe you're a character within
the programme. <br/>
SEVEN: Why am I in Sickbay? <br/>
EMH: You were wounded in a simulation. It's my job to patch you all up
and send you back in. Half the crew is under lock and key. The rest are
fighting for their lives on the holodeck. This has been going on for
nineteen days. Dozens of battle scenarios, one more brutal than the
last. You should see what a mess you were after the Crusades. <br/>
SEVEN: Will I be sent into another simulation? <br/>
EMH: Yes, but this time with an advantage. I have found a way to
disable the interface by remodulating one of your Borg implants to emit
a jamming signal. Once the Hirogen have brought you back to the
holodeck, the jamming signal will activate within seconds. <br/>
SEVEN: My objective? <br/>
EMH: You mind a control panel inside the holodeck and engage the bridge
access relays. That will enable Ensign Kim and me to deactivate all the
neural interfaces. After Captain Janeway and the crew regain awareness,
you can work with them to mount a resistance against the Hirogen. <br/>
SEVEN: What simulation will I be entering? <br/>
EMH: World War Two. A twentieth century Earth conflict. Do you know
anything about it? <br/>
SEVEN: Nothing. <br/>
EMH: That could be a problem. Once the interface is disabled, you won't
remember anything about your role in the simulation. Think of it as a
new social setting. Do your best to fit in. <br/>
MEDIC: This is the last neural interface. When you've finished
with her, you'll help me replicate more. <br/>

JANEWAY: What are you waiting for? <br/>TURANJ: I am a hunter. You are my prey. Run.<br/>(Janeway runs into the corridor. Turanj follows.) </font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sainte
Claire - Street]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. Out. Our holographic allies are losing ground. The
German troops are surrounding the city. <br/>
PARIS: I don't know how much longer we can hold them off. These weapons
are pretty crude. They're not much help. <br/>
TORRES: Maybe we should fall back? <br/>
CHAKOTAY: Where to? They're coming in from all sides. Tuvok, any chance
we can get through that breach in the hologrid. <br/>
TUVOK: Unlikely. Twenty more Hirogen have taken up position near the
opening. We are outnumbered. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: How's it going? <br/>
SEVEN: I'm modifying this explosive device to emit a photonic burst. It
will be harmless to organic tissue but it should disrupt all
holographic activity within twenty metres. <br/>
CHAKOTAY: We'll try to buy you some time.<br/>(Janeway
gets into the Jefferies tube network before Turanj catches up with her.
He doubles back, feels the hatch, then opens it.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> HIROGEN:
I'll be in Sickbay. <br/>(Kim
is left unsupervised. He does his bit on Auxilliary Systems 0470.
Charging Holo-Emitters. Holo-Emitter Overload Initiated. The countdown
starts at 9 minutes.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sainte
Claire - Street]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NAZI: Schnell! Schell!<br/>CHAKOTAY:
They're closing in. Seven!  <br/>(Seven pulls the pin on her modified
grenade, stands to throw it and gets shot. A GI tries to get to it,
then it goes off and he disappears, along with the weapons. The Nazi's
weren't close enough.)<br/>
KAPITAN: Surrender. <br/>(Janeway limps to a
place where a holographic soldier no longer has any legs. She drags him
back and they reappear, and she carries on. Meanwhile, Seven is helped
to her feet. Real life thunder rumbles overhead.)<br/>KAPITAN: Verdamt. Bring that one to me. I will spare
your life for now, but only because you are carrying a German child. <br/>

(Turanj hears a noise and turns down a side corridor. Janeway is in the
shadows, behind fallen debris. Turanj stands near the fallen soldier.)<br/>JANEWAY: Please don't do this. I can be of use to you. I can help you
repair the ship. Don't kill me.<br/>(Turanj
steps forward. His rifle starts to disappear, he looks down and she
hits him with a metal pipe. Then she picks up the rifle and he runs away.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sainte

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(A firing squad is formed.)<br/>KAPITAN: Against the wall. Your deaths will serve the glory of the
Reich. Prepare to fire. <br/>(A swarm of Klingons burst through the barricade. The Nazi soldiers go to meet them. Turanj looks down on the melee.)<br/>
NEELIX: Fight on, warriors! This way! <br/>
EMH: Qapla', gentlemen. Qapla'! <br/>(Neelix and the EMH stay under a cafe awning as the rain pours. The Kapitan knocks down Paris, then a Klingon kills him.) <br/>

JANEWAY: This hunt is over. Tell your hunters to stand down. I'll use
this if you force me to.<br/>(Turanj
steps forward. Janeway shoots him and he falls backwards into the
holodeck, down three decks. Seven seconds to holo-emitter overload.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sainte
Claire - Street]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(All the holographics characters vanish.)<br/>CHAKOTAY: It's over. Let's go. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
Captain's log, stardate 51715.2. The damage to Voyager has been
extreme. Both sides have taken heavy casualties, and it's clear that no
one is going to win this conflict. The fighting has reached a
standstill and the remaining Hirogen have agreed to negotiate a truce. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cargo
Bay two]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> YOUNG
HIROGEN: What is this? <br/>
JANEWAY: An optronic datacore. You can use it to create holodeck
technology on your own vessels. I made a promise with your leader
before he died, that I would give this knowledge to the Hirogen. Take
it. <br/>
YOUNG HIROGEN: His ideas were unconventional. I do not share them. <br/>
JANEWAY: Was he any more unconventional than you are? Calling a
ceasefire with your prey? Only a few days ago, the thought of speaking
with us on equal terms would've been inconceivable, but here we are.
Accept this trophy. You can use it to create a new future for your
people. At the very least, you can hang it on your bulkhead.<br/>(She
hands it to him, and he bows his head briefly. Janeway returns the
gesture and the Hirogen leave Voyager to sail on alone.) </font>
