minor injuries. </font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The Qomar have a tiny set of ridges
from the bridge of the nose to half way up their foreheads. The EMH is
having issues with a small grey-haired man, who is one of four in
Sickbay.)<br/>ABARCA:
Stay away. <br/>
EMH: If you don't cooperate, I can't treat you. <br/>
ABARCA: When we agreed to be examined by this ship's medical officer,
we didn't know that you were a primitive computer matrix.<br/>
EMH: I assure you there is nothing primitive about me. I am programmed
to perform more than five million medical procedures. <br/>
ABARCA: Does that include bloodletting? <br/>
EMH: No, but I'll be happy to add it to my repertoire.<br/>(A young female speaks slowly and with hand gestures to the EMH.)<br/>
TINCOO: We are ready to return to our ship. Could you contact one of
your superiors? <br/>
EMH: Doctor to the Captain. Please report to Sickbay. <br/>
JANEWAY [OC]: Already on my way. <br/>(The EMH speaks slowly and clearly to Tincoo.)<br/>
EMH: The Captain is coming here now. If you want to talk to her, you
can have a seat.<br/>
TINCOO: It is a very irritating programme. <br/>
ABARCA: Maybe we can disable its speech subroutines. <br/>
EMH: You're not authorised to do that! <br/>(Janeway enters.)<br/>
JANEWAY: How are our guests? <br/>
EMH: Their injuries are minor. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for
their lack of manners. <br/>
JANEWAY: Doctor. <br/>
ABARCA: What is the status of our ship?<br/>
JANEWAY: To be honest, we're having a little trouble understanding your
technology. <br/>
ABARCA: The problem is your technology. Interference from your
antiquated scanning devices shut down our propulsion system. <br/>
TINCOO: Forgive us, Captain. We live in a closed system. We are not
accustomed to interacting with other species, especially inferior ones.
<br/>
JANEWAY: Well then, I guess we'll leave the repairs in your superior
hands. <br/>
ABARCA: Our injuries will have to be treated first. Is there someone
other than this hologram who could help us? <br/>
JANEWAY: No one who's better qualified. <br/>
TINCOO: Very well. <br/>
JANEWAY: Try to bear with our deficiencies just a little longer. <br/>(Janeway rolls her eyes at the EMH and leaves.)<br/>
EMH: This way, please. (sings) I've been working on the railroad, all
the live long day. I've been working on the railroad, just to pass the
time away. <br/>
ABARCA: What is that? <br/>
EMH: This? A hypospray. <br/>
ABARCA: No. What you were doing.<br/>
EMH: Preparing your medication. <br/>
TINCOO: No. With your voice. <br/>
EMH: You mean singing? <br/>
TINCOO: Singing. <br/>
ABARCA: Do it again. <br/>
TINCOO: Yes, do it again. <br/>EMH: (sings) Someone's in the kitchen with
Dinah, someone's in the kitchen I know. Someone's in the kitchen with
Dinah, strummin' on the old banjo and singing Fee fi fiddly i o, Fee fi
fiddly i o, Fee fi fiddly i o. Strummin' on the old banjo. <br/>
TINCOO: It is a unique mathematical variation. <br/>
ABARCA: Difficult to quantify. <br/>
TINCOO: How do you suppose the algorithms are generated? <br/>
ABARCA: Maybe it's a fractal. <br/>
TINCOO: Or waveform calculus? <br/>
EMH: Do you mean to say a culture as superior as yours has never heard
music of any kind? <br/>
TINCOO: There are other kinds of music? <br/>
EMH: Of course. The little ditty I just sang is an early American folk
song. But countless cultures have produced thousands of types of music.
Instrumental, choral, orchestral. <br/>
ABARCA: What is the purpose of this music? Is it an encryption code of
some kind? <br/>
EMH: There is a mathematical component to music, but primarily it's a
form of artistic expression. <br/>
TINCOO: Artistic expression? <br/>
EMH: Using sounds and images to convey ideas and emotions. <br/>
ABARCA: Why would anyone do that? <br/>
EMH: Well, to communicate their feelings. <br/>
ABARCA: Can't they do that through speech? <br/>
EMH: Yes, but music is much more expressive and entertaining. <br/>
TINCOO: You mean to say that this music is recreational? <br/>
EMH: It does have other applications. As a matter of fact, I've
recently been doing some research into its therapeutic properties. But,
yes, primarily we use it for enjoyment. <br/>
ABARCA: We? You mean to say others aboard your ship are capable of
producing this phenomenon?<br/>
EMH: Well, maybe not with my level of expertise, but there are quite a
few members of this crew who possess musical skills. <br/>
TINCOO: Maybe we judged this culture too quickly. <br/>
EMH: Our database contains the works of thousands of musicians and
composers. If you'd like, I could download some selections for you. <br/>
TINCOO: Could you sing them for us?

surprisingly, have invited us to visit their system. Apparently, it's
no longer closed to outsiders. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The Qomar homeworld has plenty of satellites and spacecraft.)<br/>JANEWAY:
Harry, can you make sense of any of this? <br/>
KIM: We're picking up thousands of subspace transmissions, all
encrypted differently. <br/>
PARIS: Between the satellites and the spacecraft, it's like navigating
an obstacle course.<br/>
CHAKOTAY: With all this traffic, the Qomar might not even know we're
here. <br/>
TUVOK: Apparently, they do. We are being hailed. <br/>
TINCOO [on viewscreen]: Captain, you now have the privilege of meeting
Prelate Koru. <br/>
KORU [on viewscreen]: Welcome to the Qomar Planetary Alliance. <br/>
JANEWAY: Thank you, Prelate. We're looking forward to learning more
about your culture. <br/>
KORU [on viewscreen]: Our civilisation is no doubt intimidating. We'll
do what we can to avoid overwhelming you during your stay.<br/>
JANEWAY: I appreciate that. I understand we're not as advanced as you,
but we're fast learners, and we'd like to <br/>
KORU [on viewscreen]: We want to learn more about the algorithmic
expressions you call music. <br/>
JANEWAY: We're prepared to give you complete access to our musical
database, as well <br/>
KORU [on viewscreen]: Your Emergency Medical Hologram. We'd consider an
exchange of technology, if you give us complete access to this device.<br/>
JANEWAY: I believe he's made some recordings. <br/>
KORU [on viewscreen]: No, not recordings. <br/>
JANEWAY: How about a recital? <br/>
KORU [on viewscreen]: Recital? <br/>
JANEWAY: A live performance. We can put together a programme of various
styles of music. <br/>
KORU [on viewscreen]: Will the Emergency Medical Hologram sing? <br/>
JANEWAY: He'll be the star attraction. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Mess

<br/></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The recital is underway.) <br/>EMH: (sings) Dio, che nell'alma infondere amor volesti e speme, desio
nel core accendere Tu dei di liberta. <br/>(The Qomar are greatly impressed.)<br/>
EMH: Thank you. You're very kind. That was a selection from the opera
Don Carlos, composed by Giuseppe Verdi a towering figure in Earth's
musical history. Another human musical form is called jazz, which has
flourished since the early twentieth century. Mathematically, you'll
find the rhythmic structures quite interesting, particularly the use of
syncopation, which is said to make the music swing. You may also notice
some fascinating trigonometric functions in the counterpoint, but I
suppose I'm going off on a tangent, aren't I?<br/>(The Qomar find this highly amusing.)<br/>EMH: So, without further ado,
I give you Harry Kim and the
Kimtones! <br/>(Kim's group play, but the Qomar are not fond of instrumentals.)<br/>
ABARCA: We wish to hear the Doctor. <br/>
TINCOO: Yes, the Doctor. <br/>
PARIS: Doc, they're dying up there. You've got to do something. <br/>
EMH: Pick up the tempo. (sings) That old black magic has me in its
spell. That old black magic that you weave so well. Those icy fingers
up and down my spine. The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine.
The same old tingle that I feel inside. And then that elevator starts
its ride, And down and down I go. Round and round I go, Like a leaf
that's caught in the tide. (Later -)<br/>PARIS:
Well, if you like jazz, you're going to love rock 'n' roll. It was one
of the twentieth century's greatest inventions. <br/>
ABARCA: Does the Doctor sing rock 'n' roll? <br/>
CHAKOTAY: I wouldn't say it's his favourite genre. <br/>
PARIS: No, he's more of an opera man. <br/>
ABARCA: As am I. <br/>
VINKA: Aren't you one of the musicians? <br/>
KIM: Harry Kim. <br/>
VINKA: Vinka. <br/>
KIM: Welcome aboard Voyager. Er, if you'd like to see the rest of the
ship, I'd be happy to give you a tour. <br/>
VINKA: Maybe later. I was wondering if you could introduce me to the
Doctor. <br/>
JANEWAY: Congratulations, Doctor, you stole the show. <br/>
EMH: Thank you, Captain, but I can't take all the credit. There was
something in the air. A certain magic. It was one of those rare moments
when audience and performer become one. <br/>
KORU: Doctor. <br/>
EMH: Prelate. Tincoo. <br/>
KORU: I will introduce your singing to more of our people. <br/>
EMH: I'm flattered. <br/>
KORU: You will perform on our planet. <br/>
EMH: I'd consider it an honour, but you'll have to negotiate the terms
with my representative. <br/>
KORU: I don't understand. <br/>
JANEWAY: I believe the Doctor is referring to me, Prelate. Another
concert would mean extending our stay. When would you want to schedule
the performance?<br/>
KORU: As soon as possible. <br/>
TINCOO: The Doctor could perform in one of the lecture halls at the
university. <br/>
EMH: I'm not sure a lecture hall would meet the acoustic requirements. <br/>
TINCOO: I'll help you make whatever modifications you think are
necessary. <br/>
JANEWAY: Sounds like you've got yourself a booking, Doctor.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: I'd
like to reproduce a backdrop which was used in a production of
Pagliacci at Teatro de la Scala, Earth's most famous opera house. <br/>
TINCOO: It's beautiful. <br/>
EMH: Your taste in design is as refined as your taste in music. <br/>
TINCOO: We'll replicate it for you. <br/>
EMH: Excellent, but we still have the problem with the sight lines. <br/>
TORRES: What's wrong with the sight lines? <br/>
EMH: If you consider the height of the average Qomar, it's obvious that
anyone seated in the back five rows will have an obstructed view. <br/>
TORRES: You're right. They won't be able to see anything but the top of
your head. The glare could blind them. <br/>
EMH: You'll have to excuse Lieutenant Torres. Her appreciation of music
is limited to a smattering of Klingon drinking songs. We'll have to
increase the rake of the floor by five degrees. <br/>
TORRES: You really think they're going to redesign an entire building
just to appeal to your vanity? <br/>
EMH: Vanity has nothing to do with it, Lieutenant. I'm concerned about
my audience. <br/>
TINCOO: We are prepared to make whatever changes the Doctor thinks are
necessary. <br/>
EMH: Thank you, Tincoo. While we're at it, Lieutenant, I'll need some help with my
wardrobe. <br/>
TORRES: I'm an Engineer, not a costume designer. <br/>
EMH: I'd like you to make an adjustment to my mobile emitter that will
allow me to make quick changes between songs.<br/>
TINCOO: That sounds exciting.<br/>
EMH: Oh, it will be. I plan to segue from Don Juan to Rigoletto in the
blink of an eye. It will be a triumph of <br/>
TORRES: Arrogance and self-absorption? Just trying to help. <br/>
TINCOO: Your crewmates don't seem to appreciate your abilities. <br/>
EMH: You've noticed that too? <br/>
TINCOO: That must be very frustrating for you. <br/>

TINCOO: You look perfect. <br/>
EMH: I wish I had a subroutine to eliminate pre-show jitters. <br/>
TINCOO: I could help you add one to your programme. <br/>
EMH: You're very sweet. I'm just a little nervous.<br/>
TINCOO: Why? <br/>
EMH: I'm about to expose your entire culture to music for the first
time. The responsibility is enormous. <br/>
TINCOO: Your performance tonight will be transmitted to hundreds of
millions of people. <br/>

Report. <br/>
KIM: I didn't order Red alert, Captain. <br/>
JANEWAY: Well, someone did. <br/>
KIM: The command originated in Astrometrics. <br/>
SEVEN [OC]: Seven of Nine to the Captain. I've found evidence that the
Qomar are attempting to sabotage Voyager. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
What have you got? <br/>
SEVEN: I believe the Qomar are attempting to disable our comm. system. <br/>
JANEWAY: How? <br/>
SEVEN: By overloading it with millions of teraquads of irrelevant data.
<br/>
JANEWAY: What do you mean by irrelevant? <br/>(Seven puts them up on the big screen.)<br/>JANEWAY: They're transmissions, all
addressed to the Doctor. <br/>
SEVEN: Precisely. I've only been able to decipher a small fraction of
them so far, but they include invitations to social and scientific
functions, requests for personal encounters, and cloying tributes to
the Doctor's talents. <br/>
JANEWAY: Computer, stand down Red alert. This isn't sabotage, Seven.
This is fan mail. <br/>
SEVEN: Fan mail? <br/>
JANEWAY: People who admire performers are called fans. <br/>
SEVEN: The word, I believe, derives from fanatic.<br/>
JANEWAY: Exactly. <br/>
SEVEN: Why would the Doctor inspire fanaticism among the Qomar? <br/>
JANEWAY: Music is new to them. Clearly, they're very excited about it. <br/>
SEVEN: This glorification of the individual is irrational. The Doctor
is merely reproducing the work of others. Why do his fans fixate solely
on him? <br/>
JANEWAY: I suppose he's the embodiment of what they admire. He can do
something they can't. That makes him special. <br/>
SEVEN: Perhaps, but that doesn't explain their interest in the minutiae
of the Doctor's life. What does he do in his spare time? To how many
decimal places can he calculate pi? This one wants to know his
favourite quadratic equation. <br/>
JANEWAY: People have always fantasised about knowing celebrities
personally. I suppose it's a way of making themselves feel more
important. <br/>
TUVOK [OC]: Tuvok to Janeway. <br/>
JANEWAY: Go ahead. <br/>
TUVOK [OC]: We have a security problem on deck two. <br/>

Doctor, we're the envy of millions of Qomar.

Our efforts to accommodate them have gotten out of hand. <br/>

expected. <br/>
TUVOK: Much greater. I recommend we refuse all further requests for
transport from the surface.<br/>
JANEWAY: Agreed. <br/>

you're enjoying yourself Doctor, but this is getting a little
excessive. <br/>

Qomar goes smoothly. <br/>
JANEWAY: Does that include using our replicator reserves to create
miniaturised versions of yourself? <br/>
EMH: I would never do such a thing. As a matter of fact, the Qomar have
devoted an entire holo-processing plant to manufacturing them for me. <br/>

duties. I haven't received a report in three days. <br/>

Admit it. <br/>
JANEWAY: I am responsible for the medical needs of this crew. If I let
you leave, what kind of captain would I be? <br/>
EMH: Every other Starfleet officer chose to be here, but I never had a
choice, until now. I've given this crew everything for five years. Isn't
it worth anything? Haven't I earned the right to self-determination?
You've lost other systems before and always managed to find a solution.
You'll manage without me. <br/>

EMH: The Qomar are a technologically advanced species. I have no doubt
that my maintenance requirements will be met. <br/>
JANEWAY: Now which one of us is looking at you as a piece of
technology? I'm not talking about your maintenance needs. I'm talking
about your emotional needs. You've got people on this ship who care
about you. <br/>

EMH: What makes you think that's going to happen? <br/>
JANEWAY: Fame is often temporary. <br/>
EMH: This isn't just about fame. <br/>
JANEWAY: Oh, really? <br/>
EMH: If you must know, there's a woman involved. One who appreciates me
in a way no one on this crew ever has.<br/>
JANEWAY: Well, it sounds like you'll have everything you need. <br/>
EMH: I believe I will. <br/>
JANEWAY: I hope so, Doctor. Because once Voyager's gone, you won't be
able to change your mind. <br/>
EMH: That's a risk I'm willing to take. <br/>
JANEWAY: As your Captain, I should refuse this resignation. But as your
friend, it wouldn't be right to stand in your way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: And
you can't let the Captain ignore her health. She's notorious for
finding any excuse to miss her appointments. <br/>
PARIS: I'll send her weekly reminders. <br/>
EMH: And when Mister Neelix becomes convinced that he's suffering from
the Toluncan ague, which he does every flu season, don't argue with
him, just give him a placebo. <br/>
PARIS: Doc, I've been assisting you for three years. I know the drill. <br/>
EMH: Yes, I suppose you do. Remember, I'll be within comm. range for at
least another month, so if any problems should arise. <br/>
PARIS: Doc, you're not really going to do this, are you? <br/>
EMH: I would have thought you of all people would be glad to see me go.
<br/>
PARIS: Are you kidding? Who am I going to torment after you're gone? <br/>
EMH: Well, I've got some more goodbyes. I'll check in with you before I
leave. <br/>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
Hello, Seven. I wanted to see you before I left. I've downloaded some
social lessons we haven't covered yet. There are seventeen new
chapters. <br/>
SEVEN: Does one of them include instructions for ending a friendship? <br/>
EMH: Our friendship's not over, Seven. <br/>
SEVEN: It will be difficult to maintain if we never see each other
again. <br/>
EMH: I know it'll be hard for you when I'm gone. <br/>
SEVEN: I will adapt. <br/>
EMH: Yes, I suppose you will. But it'll be hard for me. <br/>
SEVEN: Why? You're getting everything you've ever wanted. <br/>
EMH: I thought you'd be the first one to understand my desire to grow
as an individual. <br/>
SEVEN: What I don't understand is why you can't do that aboard Voyager.
<br/>
EMH: I feel I've accomplished all I can here. Oh, there's the
occasional medical mystery that challenges my programming, but mostly
it's become routine. And frankly, I feel my talents are often taken for
granted. But when I'm standing on that stage performing, and I see
those rapt faces in the audience, I feel I finally know what it's like
to be made of flesh and blood. <br/>
SEVEN: You simply crave attention, applause, fan mail.<br/>
EMH: What if I do?<br/>
SEVEN: Those things are irrelevant. <br/>
EMH: To you, maybe. But to me, it makes me feel appreciated, even loved.
Not for what I've been programmed to do, but for who I've become. <br/>
KIM [OC]: Doctor, you're receiving a transmission. <br/>
EMH: Route it to Cargo Bay two. <br/>
TINCOO [OC]: Doctor, this is Tincoo. I want to see you immediately. I
have something to show you. <br/>
EMH: What is it? <br/>
TINCOO [OC]: A surprise. I think you'll be very pleased. <br/>
EMH: I'll beam down as soon as I can. Seven. <br/>
SEVEN: You shouldn't keep your fans waiting. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Tincoo's
lab]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TINCOO:
Thank you for being so prompt. <br/>
EMH: Of course. What's the surprise? <br/>
TINCOO: I had an inspiration. <br/>
EMH: Another musical composition? <br/>
TINCOO: Better. <br/>(She calls up a holographic Qomar EMH.)<br/>
EMH: What's this? <br/>
TINCOO: I've solved all our problems. <br/>
EMH: I wasn't aware that we had any. <br/>
TINCOO: Well, you were reluctant to leave your ship, and you also
doubted your ability to sing my composition, so I created a superior
holomatrix. <br/>
EMH: I don't understand. <br/>
TINCOO: It's simple. Now you can stay aboard Voyager, and he can sing
for us. Listen. <br/>(The new holomatrix can cover many more octaves than the EMH.)<br/>
EMH: You can't make a superior singer simply by creating a new matrix. <br/>
QOMAR HOLOGRAM: I beg to differ. My vocal processors are enhanced with
polyphonic sequencers. I am not only capable of singing notes well
beyond your limited range, I can produce multi-harmonic overtones
through the use of amplitude vacilla <br/>(The EMH turns him off.)<br/>
TINCOO: Why did you do that? <br/>
EMH: Tincoo, music is more than mathematics. And I am much more than a
programme with musical subroutines. All of my experience, all of my
passion, goes into every note that I sing. When you listen to me, when
my singing moves you, you're not just hearing notes. You're hearing my
artistry. My soul.<br/>
TINCOO: I've duplicated that, too. <br/>
EMH: I thought you wanted me. <br/>
TINCOO: I did, but now I've developed a far more sophisticated piece of
technology. <br/>
EMH: Technology. <br/>
TINCOO: I thought you would be pleased. You seemed reluctant to leave
your ship. <br/>
EMH: You told me that the time you had spent with me was the most
stimulating of your life. <br/>
TINCOO: It was. You inspired me to do my greatest work. <br/>
EMH: But I thought <br/>
TINCOO: Yes? <br/>
EMH: That you and I <br/>
TINCOO: What? <br/>
EMH: Well, I suppose I'm no longer on the bill tomorrow. <br/>
TINCOO: Of course you are. It will be your farewell performance. <br/>
EMH: Of course. </font></p>

You wanted to see me? <br/>
EMH: I need your clearance code to delete my medical database. <br/>
TORRES: You sure you want to do that? If you give one of your fans a
heart attack you won't be able to resuscitate him. <br/>
EMH: I need more space in my matrix. <br/>
TORRES: For what? <br/>
EMH: To expand my musical subroutines so that I can sing this
composition. <br/>
TORRES: Well, I'm surprised you're asking me for help. I recall your
saying that my appreciation for music was limited to a smattering of
Klingon drinking songs. <br/>
EMH: Please, B'Elanna, I'm asking you as a friend. Everything depends
on this. <br/>
TORRES: What's so important about this composition? <br/>
EMH: Tincoo wrote it for me. <br/>
TORRES: Your girlfriend? <br/>
EMH: I wouldn't call her that. <br/>
TORRES: Don't tell me you two had a fight. <br/>
EMH: Let's just say she doesn't appreciate me quite as much as I
thought she did. But that will all change. Once I perform this, she
will see me for the artist I truly am. <br/>
TORRES: Look, Doc, I don't know anything about this woman or why she
doesn't appreciate you, and I may not be an expert on music, but I'm a
pretty good engineer. I can expand your musical subroutines all you
like. I can even reprogramme you to be a whistling teapot. But, if I do
that, it won't be you anymore. </font></p>

stage]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The EMH is in a simple evening suit.)<br/>EMH:
Tonight, I was planning to perform a song composed by one of your own
people. When you consider she heard music for the first time only a few
days ago, it's an extraordinary accomplishment. But although it's a
very beautiful composition, I'm afraid it's beyond my abilities. So
instead, I'm going to sing an old Neapolitan ballad. It's a song about
lost love. (sings) Sotto la grónda della torre antica, una róndine
amica a lo sbocciar del
almondo or lui tornata. Ritorni tutti l'anni sempre alla stessa data,
monti
e mari sa varca per tornar. Solo amore quando fugenda lontana sper
invano,
ma non torni piu. Sper invano ma non torna piu. <br/>(That
was Rondine al nido by Vincenzo de Crescenzo. It receives polite
applause, and Janeway wipes away a tear. The EMH leaves the stage.)<br/>
TINCOO: Thank you, Doctor. That was fascinating. It is because of your
inspiration that I can now present to you a new and exciting musical
programme. A singing holographic matrix designed specifically to extend
the range of humanoid vocal capabilities, singing my own musical
composition. <br/>(The
Qomar holomatrix takes the stage and performs the sound composition.
Its multi-tonal section complete with whistling kettle receives
applause from the Qomar, and leaves the humans completely nonplussed.) </font></p>

myself your loyal fan. <br/>
