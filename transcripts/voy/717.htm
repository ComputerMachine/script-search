ADMIRAL PARIS [on screen]: Cold and rainy as usual. <br/>
JANEWAY: It sounds delightful. Lieutenant Barclay, my congratulations
on establishing the first trans-galactic comm. link. You've earned a
place in the history books. <br/>

Harry and Seven who suggested bouncing a tachyon beam off of the
quantum singularity. <br/>
KIM: Just be sure to thank us when you accept the Daystrom prize. <br/>
ADMIRAL PARIS [on screen]: I wish we had more time for small talk but
the singularity only stays in alignment for eleven minutes a day. <br/>

all your work, Reg. <br/>

constant reminder that you're different from everyone else. I wanted

TORRES: Brothers? <br/>
EMH: Hundreds of EMH mark ones. Identical to me in every respect
except, they've been condemned to a menial existence. Scrubbing
conduits, mining dilithium. There's a long history of writers drawing
attention to the plight of the oppressed. The Vedek's Song, for example
tells the story of the occupation of Bajor. <br/>

<br/>
PARIS: This isn't about that dermal regenerator I misplaced, is it? <br/>
EMH: You know very well what this is about. You accessed my holo-novel
without permission and replaced it with your own hackneyed narrative. <br/>
PARIS: Hey, I'm just writing what I know. <br/>
EMH: You destroyed a work of art that took months to create. <br/>
PARIS: Relax, Doc. I saved your programme in a backup file. But I was
just trying to make a point. <br/>
EMH: Well, you made it, with a typical lack of subtlety. <br/>
PARIS: Oh, you're one to talk. Your programme is about as subtle as a
Ferengi mating dance. <br/>
EMH: My programme is a serious attempt at social commentary, yours is
an insulting farce! You had me drugging a patient and taking advantage
of her. <br/>
PARIS: Don't be ridiculous. That character is not you. For one thing,
he has much more hair. But what if some people ran that programme and
thought that it was based on you? <br/>
That would bother you, wouldn't it? <br/>
EMH: I don't care what people think. <br/>
PARIS: That's all you care about! You want everyone back home to think
of you as a brilliant author. <br/>
EMH: I'm not doing this for my ego. And if you could look past yours,
maybe you'd see that. <br/>
PARIS: Listen, I don't care if the whole Alpha Quadrant mistakes me for
Lieutenant Marseilles. What bothers me is that you think that's what
I'm like. <br/>
EMH: Obviously, you're nothing like Marseilles. He's self-indulgent,
immature. <br/>
PARIS: And how would you describe me? <br/>
EMH: Well, you're a married man with a child on the way. A lot of
responsibilities. <br/>

EMH: Cooking with Neelix, a Culinary Tour of the Delta Quadrant. <br/>
NEELIX: It's a holo-cookbook proposal. I was hoping to transmit it to
your publisher during my comm. link this afternoon. With your approval,
of course. <br/>
EMH: If you're looking for writing tips, there are plenty of people on
this ship eager to offer them. <br/>
NEELIX: I don't know what anyone else may have told you, but I loved
your holo-novel. <br/>
EMH: You did? <br/>
NEELIX: Absolutely. It was a rousing adventure, with an important
message too. <br/>
EMH: Exactly. This is my first chance to be appreciated not just as a
physician, but as an artist. I thought the crew would be happy for me. <br/>
NEELIX: You're going to reach a wide audience. What do you care about
the opinions of a few disgruntled shipmates? <br/>
EMH: They're my friends. I don't want to hurt them. <br/>
NEELIX: There's an old Talaxian expression. When the road before you
splits in two, take the third path. <br/>
EMH: Meaning? <br/>
NEELIX: You could make some adjustments to the programme so it won't be
so obvious it's based on Voyager. <br/>
EMH: I suppose I could change the setting, alter the characters'
physical parameters. <br/>
NEELIX: You wouldn't have to change your theme. <br/>

final draft tomorrow. <br/>

Under a strict interpretation of Federation law, Mister Broht is
correct. The Doctor has no legal rights. <br/>
EMH: Because I'm a hologram. <br/>
TUVOK: Yes. There is another option. We may be able to claim that the
holonovel reveals classified information. Starfleet could then request
that it be recalled for security purposes. <br/>
PARIS: Oh, great idea. A cover up. And then everyone will be convinced
that it's a true story. <br/>

we've been harmed by it. <br/>

ARBITRATOR [on screen]: You've made a persuasive argument, Commander,

We're exploring new territory today, so it is fitting that this hearing
is being held at Pathfinder. The Doctor exhibits many of the traits we
associate with a person. Intelligence, creativity, ambition, even
fallibility. But are these traits real, or is the Doctor merely
programmed to simulate them?
To be honest, I don't know. Eventually we will have to decide, because
the issue of holographic rights isn't going to go away. But at this time, I am not prepared to rule that the Doctor is a person
under the law.
However, it is obvious he is no ordinary hologram and while I can't say
with certainty that he is a person, I am willing to extend the legal
definition of artist to include the Doctor.
I therefore rule that he has the right to control his work. I'm
ordering all copies of his holo-novels to be recalled immediately. <br/>
